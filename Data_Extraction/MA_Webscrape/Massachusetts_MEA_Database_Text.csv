COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE BROKER LICENSING  Docket No. 2003-022  FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  MORTGAGE ONE FINANCIAL CORP.  Norwood, Massachusetts  Mortgage Broker License No. MB0624  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that MORTGAGE ONE FINANCIAL CORP. (""Mortgage One"" or the ""Corporation""), located at 1408 Providence Highway, Norwood, Massachusetts has engaged, or is engaged in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00   et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""TEMPORARY ORDER"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons engaged in the business of a mortgage broker pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  Mortgage One is, and at all relevant times has been, a corporation organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Mortgage One is located at 1408 Providence Highway, Norwood, Massachusetts, 02062, according to records submitted by Mortgage One and maintained on file with the Division.  Mortgage One is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage broker as required by General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. Mortgage One holds mortgage broker license number MB0624 which is set to expire on May 31, 2004.  On or about June 17, 2003, Mortgage One issued correspondence to two Massachusetts consumers, Andrew Klane and Suzanne Klane (collectively, ""the borrower""), requesting that the borrower complete the enclosed mortgage loan application for a residential property located in Massachusetts and provide additional borrower information to be reviewed with the application. A copy of the correspondence received by the borrower from Mortgage One is attached as Exhibit A.  The June 17, 2003 correspondence stated, in part, that ""[Y]our current rate is 5.25, 30 fixed term, and is currently Locked."" The letter further requested that the consumer sign and return all forms therein enclosed. The Division has obtained information that the borrower submitted the completed mortgage loan application and additional materials to Mortgage One as requested.  As of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, Mortgage One has not placed the borrower's application with a qualified lender under the loan terms and conditions contained in the correspondence referenced above in paragraph 4.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1 defines a mortgage broker as, ""any person who for compensation or gain, or in the expectation of compensation or gain, directly or indirectly negotiates, places, assists in placement, finds or offers to negotiate, place, assist in placement or find mortgage loans on residential property for others.""  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2 prohibits anyone from engaging in the activity of mortgage lender, unless otherwise exempted by the statute, without obtaining a license from the Commissioner.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.11A defines the activity of entering or issuing a rate lock commitment as within the exclusive authority of the mortgage lender in a residential mortgage loan transaction.  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 1 through 9, Mortgage One has unlawfully engaged in the activity of a mortgage lender without a license from the Commissioner.  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 1 through 9, Mortgage One has misrepresented material facts or made false promises likely to influence, persuade, or induce a consumer to complete a mortgage loan application.  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 1 through 9, the Commissioner has determined that:  Mortgage One has engaged, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that the Corporation is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage broker including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00   et seq.  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to Mortgage One.  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that Mortgage One shall immediately cease engaging in the activity of a mortgage broker on residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise permitted by the terms of this TEMPORARY ORDER. Therefore, Mortgage One is ordered to immediately cease soliciting or accepting residential mortgage loan applications from consumers for residential property located in Massachusetts.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Mortgage One shall immediately place any fees previously collected from Massachusetts consumers relative to any pending mortgage loan application in a separate escrow account maintained at a federally insured bank.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Mortgage One shall immediately cease from directly or indirectly collecting any funds from consumers in consideration of a rate lock agreement relative to any residential property located in Massachusetts after the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Mortgage One shall place its entire open application list to a qualified lender with no loss to applicants. Mortgage One shall obtain the prior approval of the Commissioner before placing such applications to the qualified lender.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Mortgage One shall immediately freeze all assets of the Corporation and shall not transfer any assets of the Corporation without the prior approval of the Commissioner, nor otherwise make unavailable, any assets of the Corporation or take any action intended to diminish the value of such assets, subsequent to the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Mortgage One shall immediately secure all pending mortgage loan application files and shall make such files, in their entirety, available to the Commissioner upon request.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Mortgage One shall be liable for any additional costs incurred by Massachusetts consumers as a result of the Corporation's failure to place the consumers' applications with a qualified lender under the terms contained in a correspondence similar in substance or form to the letter provided to the consumer referenced above in paragraph 4.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Mortgage One shall, within five (5) days of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, provide the Division with a complete record, including a verification of receipt, of all funds collected from consumers in consideration of entering a rate lock agreement with such borrowers for any pending mortgage loan applications as of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Mortgage One shall submit to the Commissioner a detailed record of all of the Corporation's pending residential mortgage loan applications on property located in Massachusetts. The records to be produced shall be submitted to the Commissioner within five (5) days of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER and shall include all information on file, regarding Mortgage One's open application list, including but not necessarily limited to, the following:  The names of all individuals from whom Mortgage One has either solicited or accepted an application for a residential mortgage loan; the applicants' addresses and telephone numbers; the amount of all prepaid loan fees submitted by the customer; the amount of each loan; application status (i.e. filed, submitted to lenders); and scheduled closing dates.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Mortgage One shall submit to the Commissioner a detailed record of all mortgage lenders and financial institutions to whom Mortgage One has placed mortgage loan applications which are currently pending as of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER. Such records shall also necessarily indicate any mortgage lender or financial institution to which Mortgage One had previously attempted to place a mortgage loan application which Mortgage One has subsequently either withdrawn or had returned from such mortgage lender or financial institution and which remains pending as of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under General Laws chapter 30A.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such TEMPORARY ORDER shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from the Corporation within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER. If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this TEMPORARY ORDER shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE BROKER AND MORTGAGE LENDER LICENSING  Docket No. 2003-036  FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  PLATINUM CAPITAL GROUP  Irvine, California  Mortgage Lender and Mortgage Broker License  No.(s) MC0958 and MC3142  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that PLATINUM CAPITAL GROUP (""Platinum Capital"" or the ""Corporation""), located at 17101 Armstrong Avenue, Suite 200, Irvine, California and a branch location located at 200 Baker Avenue, Concord, Massachusetts, 01742 has engaged, or is engaged in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00   et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""TEMPORARY ORDER"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b). The activities include conducting business with unlicensed entities as well as unlawful activities being conducted by Platinum Capital in an unlicensed branch location.  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of either a mortgage lender or a mortgage broker in Massachusetts, or both, pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  Platinum Capital is, and at all relevant times has been, a corporation organized under the laws of the State of California. Platinum Capital is located at located at 17101 Armstrong Avenue, Suite 200, Irvine, California and a branch location located at 200 Baker Avenue, Concord, Massachusetts, 01742 according to records submitted by Platinum Capital and maintained on file with the Division.  Platinum Capital is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage lender and mortgage broker as required by Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. The Commissioner issued Platinum Capital&apos;s initial licenses to engage in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on March 10, 1998. On August 6, 2003, Platinum Capital was granted a branch license to conduct mortgage loan activity at 200 Baker Avenue, Concord, Massachusetts, 01742. Platinum Capital holds mortgage lender and mortgage broker license numbers MC0958 and MC3142, which are set to expire on May 31, 2004.  On September 26, 2003, duly authorized examiners from the Division, in the performance of their official duties, attempted to conduct an inspection of Platinum Capital&apos;s books, accounts, records, and files of the Corporation. The Corporation, its management and employees failed to provide immediate access to the Corporation&apos;s books and records to the examiners.  A. Failure to Acquire a Mortgage Lender or Mortgage Broker License Prior to Conducting Mortgage Loan Activity  On or about June 27, 2003, Platinum Capital submitted to the Division an application to obtain a branch license from the Commissioner to engage in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker at 200 Baker Ave., Concord, Massachusetts.  Platinum Capital was approved by the Commissioner to conduct business at the 200 Baker Ave., Concord, Massachusetts location on or about August 6, 2003.  On September 26, 2003, after being granted access to the books and records, the Division&apos;s examiners conducted an inspection of the Concord, Massachusetts branch location. Books and records reviewed by field examiners indicate that Platinum Capital had accepted applications at the Concord, Massachusetts location in early June, 2003. Further, Platinum Capital&apos;s branch pipeline report submitted to the Division subsequent to the visitation indicated that loan applications were accepted by Platinum Capital as early as April 24, 2003. Platinum Capital&apos;s branch pipeline report indicated that 27 mortgage loan applications had been accepted by Platinum Capital prior to the approval of its branch license application.  B. Findings Indicating that the Corporation had Engaged in the Mortgage Loan Business in Violation of the Memorandum of Understanding with the Corporation  On June 27, 2001, duly authorized examiners from the Division, in the performance of their official duties, conducted an examination/inspection of Platinum Capital&apos;s books, accounts, records, and files of the Corporation.  During the course of the examination/inspection, the examiners observed numerous violations, including, but not limited to, the Corporation&apos;s acting as both a mortgage lender and a mortgage broker in the same transaction, a violation also cited in a prior examination/inspection conducted by the Division.  As a result of the findings of the examination/inspection as of June 27, 2001, Platinum Capital was assessed a less-than-satisfactory compliance rating and a Memorandum of Understanding was issued by the Division and signed by the Corporation on October 10, 2001 (the ""Memorandum of Understanding"").  On or about September 26, 2003, after being granted access to the Corporation&apos;s books and records, the Commissioner conducted an inspection of the Concord, Massachusetts branch location. Books and records reviewed by field examiners indicated the recurrence of similar violations noted in the examination/inspection and which were required to be addressed and corrected pursuant to the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding. The loan files inspected by the examiners which contained documents disclosing Platinum Capital as the lender or creditor in the mortgage loan transaction when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker, included, but were not limited to, the following:  Scroll left Scroll right  Loan Number  Situs of Property  Settlement Date  0000998928  Westford, MA  August 14, 2003  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 1 through 11, Platinum Capital is not an entity otherwise exempted from the licensing requirements of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2 for those engaged in the business of a mortgage lender or a mortgage broker, or both, in Massachusetts.  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 1 through 11, Platinum Capital has unlawfully engaged in the activity of a mortgage lender without a license from the Commissioner in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, §2 and the Division&apos;s regulation 209 CMR 42.00   et seq.  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 1 through 11, Platinum Capital, while acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker, has provided consumers with misleading disclosures which, by their terms, have the tendency to make assurances to the consumer that the interest rate requested was guaranteed by Platinum Capital by operation of providing commitment letters, Truth-in-Lending disclosures and other mortgage lender disclosures. Providing consumers with such disclosures, while performing in the capacity of a mortgage broker, are repeat violations as cited in the previous examination/inspection and as set forth by the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding.  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 1 through 11, the Commissioner has determined that:  Platinum Capital has engaged, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that the Corporation is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage lender or mortgage broker including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division&apos;s regulations at 209 CMR 42.00   et seq.  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to Platinum Capital.  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that Platinum Capital, its officers, directors, employees, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of a mortgage broker, as defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, §1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this TEMPORARY ORDER. Therefore, Platinum Capital is ordered to immediately cease soliciting or accepting residential mortgage loan applications from consumers for residential property located in Massachusetts.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Platinum Capital, its officers, directors, employees, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of a mortgage lender, as defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, §1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Platinum Capital shall immediately place any fees previously collected from Massachusetts consumers relative to any pending mortgage loan applications in a separate escrow account maintained at a federally insured bank.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Platinum Capital shall place its entire open application list to a qualified lender with no loss to applicants. The open application list to be placed with a qualified lender shall include all transactions in which Platinum Capital was performing in the capacity of either a mortgage broker or a mortgage lender. Platinum Capital shall obtain the prior approval of the Commissioner before placing such applications to the qualified lender.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Platinum Capital shall submit to the Commissioner a detailed record of all of the Corporation&apos;s pending residential mortgage loan applications on property located in Massachusetts. The records to be produced shall be submitted to the Commissioner within five (5) days of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER and shall include all information on file, regarding Platinum Capital&apos;s open application list, including but not necessarily limited to, the following:  The names of all individuals from whom Platinum Capital has accepted an application for a residential mortgage loan; the applicants&apos; addresses and telephone numbers; the amount of all prepaid loan fees submitted by the customer; the amount of each loan; application status (i.e. filed, submitted to lenders); scheduled closing dates; an indication of whether Platinum Capital was performing in the capacity of a mortgage broker or a mortgage lender in the transaction; and a list of applicable wholesale lenders. The latter list should include telephone numbers of contact persons familiar with Platinum Capital&apos;s submitted loans.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Platinum Capital shall immediately secure all pending mortgage loan application files and shall make such files, in their entirety, available to the Commissioner upon request.

The balance sheet and statement of income and expense shall be signed and dated by an authorized officer of Platinum Capital under the pains and penalties of perjury to certify that the information reported is true and accurate and prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this TEMPORARY ORDER shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under General Laws chapter 30A.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such TEMPORARY ORDER shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from Platinum Capital within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER. If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this TEMPORARY ORDER shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.

(""KN Management""), located at 6 Bartkus Farm Road, Concord, Massachusetts, has engaged, or is engaged in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of General Laws chapter 255E, and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""ORDER"") pursuant to subsection (b) of General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons engaged in mortgage broker activities pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E.  On February 27, 2003, the Division received an application from Nathan Smith for a mortgage broker license pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E.  On March 5, 2003, Articles of Organization were filed with the Secretary of the Commonwealth for Approved Discount Mortgage, LLC, 200 Baker Avenue, Concord, Massachusetts with John Kress Williams and Nathan Smith as Managers.  On March 26, 2003, Articles of Organization were filed with the Secretary of the Commonwealth for KN Management, Inc., 6 Bartkus Farm Road, Concord, Massachusetts with John Kress Williams and Nathan Smith as officers.  On or about April 19, 2003, KN Management commenced accepting mortgage loan applications. Mortgage loan leads were taken from primarily the Internet through a site called TheLoanPage.com of Baltimore, Maryland. Leads and subsequent applications were from various states including Massachusetts. Loan applications identified the Loan Interviewer&apos;s employer as Approved Discount Mortgage, LLC, 200 Baker Avenue, Concord, Massachusetts.  The Branch pipeline report provided to the Division by Jack Daly of Platinum Capital Group (""Platinum""), Irvine, California indicates that applications were accepted for credit approval from KN Management as early as April 24, 2003.  On May 1, 2003, numerous loan applications were taken identifying the interviewer&apos;s employer as Approved Discount Mortgage LLC or Novastar Home Mortgage, Inc. (""Novastar""). Numerous disclosures identify Novastar of Norwalk, Connecticut as the lender.  On May 12, 2003, the Division received an application from Approved Discount Mortgage, LLC for a mortgage lender and mortgage broker license. The application included a reference letter dated March 19, 2003 signed by Serge Bevil, identified as an owner of Landmark Financial at the same address in Norwalk, Connecticut as Novastar. The Division had previously approved a mortgage broker license for Novastar, 607 Main Street, Norwalk, Connecticut naming Serve Bevil as the manager. The Division has no record that a Landmark Financial branch is located at this address at this time.  On or about June 1, 2003, applications continued to be processed with some disclosures identifying Novastar as the lender and some identifying Platinum Capital Group as the lender.  On June 3, 2003, a loan to Carol and Paul Brown was closed. Numerous fees were paid to KN Management as indicated on the settlement statement.  On June 6, 2003, Jack Daly said Platinum gave their approval to open a branch office in Concord, Massachusetts at 200 Baker Avenue, Concord, Massachusetts.  On June 11, 2003, the Division denied the application of Nathan Smith for a mortgage broker license for failing to pay the investigation fee and failing to respond to two requests for additional information.  On or about June 27, 2003, an application for a branch location for Platinum Mortgage Group at 200 Baker Avenue, Concord, Massachusetts was received by the Division.  KN Management continued processing loan applications though Novastar and Platinum in July 2003. The Branch pipeline report indicates that 23 loans were processed by Platinum prior to approval of a branch license.  On August 6, 2003, the Division approved the branch license for Platinum.  On August 12, 2003, the Division issued a cease and desist letter to Approved Discount Mortgage at 200 Baker Avenue, Concord, Massachusetts.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2 states, in part, that:  No person shall act as a mortgage broker...with respect to residential property unless first obtaining a license from the commissioner...  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 2 through 17, KN Management is operating the business of a mortgage broker without a license, within the meaning of General Laws chapter 255E.  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 2 through 17, KN Management has unlawfully engaged in the business of a mortgage broker pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE LENDER AND  MORTGAGE BROKER  LICENSING  Docket No. 2003-039  FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  INSTAFI.COM  Irvine, California  Mortgage Lender and Mortgage Broker  License No. MC2158 and MC3119  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that INSTAFI.COM (""Instafi.com""), located at 2600 Michaelson Drive, Suite 300, Irvine, California has engaged, or is engaged in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""TEMPORARY ORDER"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage lender or a mortgage broker, or both, pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  Instafi.com is, and at all relevant times has been, organized under the laws of the State of California. Instafi.com is located at 2600 Michaelson Drive, Suite 300, Irvine, California, according to records submitted by Instafi.com and maintained on file with the Division.  Instafi.com is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage lender and as a mortgage broker as required by General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. Instafi.com holds mortgage lender and mortgage broker license numbers MC2158 and MC3119 which are set to expire on May 31, 2004.  On or about December 22, 2003, the Division received a copy of an Internet news article which reported that Instafi.com had gone out of business. Comments offered by a representative of Instafi.com&apos;s management, which were also included in the article, confirmed that Instafi.com was ceasing operations and that a reduced staff had been retained to dissolve the business.  The Internet news article further reported that several hundred pending applications, initially accepted by Instafi.com, had been transferred to another California-based mortgage lender company, similarly licensed in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as a mortgage lender.  A representative of the Division, during the course of his official duties, was able to confirm with a representative of the mortgage lender licensee referenced above in Section 5, that approximately five of the mortgage loan applications which the licensee had received from Instafi.com related to residential property located in Massachusetts.  As of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, the Division had not received from Instafi.com any written or verbal notification that Instafi.com intended to close its business at either of the two licensed locations maintained by Instafi.com.  As of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, the Division had not received from Instafi.com any written or verbal notification of a change in the officers or directors of Instafi.com.  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 1 through 8, Instafi.com failed to provide the Commissioner with prior written notice of the closing for mortgage lender or mortgage broker activity of either of the licensed locations maintained by Instafi.com in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 5.  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 1 through 8, the Commissioner has reason to believe that Instafi.com has conducted, or is conducting, its business in an unsafe and unsound manner in violation of the Division&apos;s regulation 209 CMR 42.04(2)(b)(3) and 209 CMR 42.07(2)(b)(3).  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 1 through 8, the Commissioner has reason to believe that:  Instafi.com has engaged in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that Instafi.com is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage lender or mortgage broker, or both, including, but not limited to, the provisions under General Laws chapter 255E, section 4, and the Division&apos;s regulations at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq.  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing a TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to Instafi.com.  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that Instafi.com, its officers, directors, employees, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of a mortgage broker, as defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this TEMPORARY ORDER. Therefore, Instafi.com is ordered to immediately cease soliciting or accepting residential mortgage loan applications from consumers for residential property located in Massachusetts.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Instafi.com, its officers, directors, employees, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of a mortgage lender, as defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this TEMPORARY ORDER.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Instafi.com shall immediately place any fees previously collected from Massachusetts consumers relative to any pending mortgage loan applications in a separate escrow account maintained at a federally insured bank.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Instafi.com shall place its entire open application list to a qualified lender with no loss to applicants. The open application list to be placed with a qualified lender shall include all transactions in which Instafi.com was performing in the capacity of either a mortgage broker or a mortgage lender. Instafi.com shall obtain the prior approval of the Commissioner before placing any such additional applications, not previously transferred, to the qualified lender.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Instafi.com shall submit to the Commissioner a detailed record of all of the Instafi.com&apos;s pending residential mortgage loan applications on property located in Massachusetts. The records to be produced shall be submitted to the Commissioner within five (5) days of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER and shall include all information on file, regarding Instafi.com&apos;s open application list, including but not necessarily limited to, the following:  The names of all individuals from whom Instafi.com has accepted an application for a residential mortgage loan; the applicants&apos; addresses and telephone numbers; the amount of all prepaid loan fees submitted by the customer; the amount of each loan; application status (i.e. filed, submitted to lenders); scheduled closing dates; an indication of whether Instafi.com was performing in the capacity of a mortgage broker or a mortgage lender in the transaction; and a list of applicable wholesale lenders. The latter list should include telephone numbers of contact persons familiar with Instafi.com&apos;s submitted loans.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Instafi.com shall submit to the Commissioner Instafi.com&apos;s year-to-date balance sheet and statement of income and expense. The balance sheet should indicate Instafi.com&apos;s cash position at each of its depository banks as well as the corresponding bank account numbers. The balance sheet and statement of income and expense shall be signed and dated by an authorized officer of Instafi.com under the pains and penalties of perjury to certify that the information reported is true and accurate and prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this TEMPORARY ORDER shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 30A. Provided, however, that the provisions of this TEMPORARY ORDER shall not limit, estop, or otherwise prevent the Division, or any federal or state agency or department, from taking any other action affecting Instafi.com or any of its officers and directors, or their successors or assigns.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such TEMPORARY ORDER shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from Instafi.com within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER. If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this TEMPORARY ORDER shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.  By ORDER AND direction of the Commissioner of Banks.  Dated at Boston, Massachusetts, this 23rd day of December, 2003.  By: Thomas J.

Part 339. The policy and procedures are to include but are not limited to:  (a) preparation, mailing or delivering a written notice of special flood hazard determination to the borrower and to the servicer in all cases whether or not flood insurance is available under the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, for the collateral securing the loan, as required in section 339.9 of the FDIC's Rules and Regulations, 12 C.F.R. § 339.9;  (b) ensuring that flood hazard insurance coverage is obtained when required, pursuant to section 339.3 of the FDIC's Rules and Regulations, 12 C.F.R. § 339.3;  (c) ensuring that flood hazard insurance coverage, where required, remains in force throughout the life of a loan, as required by section 339.3(a) of the FDIC's Rules and Regulations;  (d) ensuring that the amount of flood hazard insurance coverage, where such insurance is required, is at least equal to the lesser of the outstanding principal balance of the loan or the maximum amount of coverage available for the particular property, as required by section 339.3(a) of the FDIC's Rules and Regulations; and,  (e) ensuring compliance with section 339.7 of the FDIC's Rules and Regulations by sending proper notices to borrowers whose flood hazard coverage has become inadequate, and by force placing such insurance when borrowers who have received such notices fail to take appropriate corrective action.  7.(a) Within 60 days from the effective date of this ORDER, the Bank shall develop and implement procedures to ensure compliance with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1691  et seq ., as implemented by Regulation B of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 12 C.F.R.

(b) In the case of each residential mortgage loan, home equity loan, and home equity line of credit originated by the Bank after December 30, 2002, in connection with which the Bank obtained the signatures of two or more joint owners of the mortgaged real estate on a note, guarantee, or other credit instrument other than a mortgage deed, the Bank shall send a letter (""Stage 1 Letter"") to at least one of such joint owners asking if the joint owners intended to be joint applicants, or whether the signatures of one or more such joint owners were required by a Bank officer or employee. The form of the Stage 1 Letter which the Bank proposes to send to such persons must be submitted to the Regional Director for approval before the Stage 1 Letters are sent. In any case where a recipient of a Stage 1 Letter replies that such a signature of a co-owner of the mortgaged property who did not originally intend to be an applicant was required by the Bank, and the Bank's action of requiring that signature was not consistent with 12 C.F.R. § 202.7(d), the Bank shall advise the replying person, by letter (""Stage 2 Letter""), of the rights set forth in this paragraph. The form of the Stage 2 Letter which the Bank proposes to send to such persons must be submitted to the Regional Director for approval before the Stage 2 Letters are sent. The Bank must release any such co-owner from any liability or obligations imposed by such instrument (other than the mortgage deed) if the original applicant was able to qualify on his/her own for the credit requested. If the original applicant was not able so to qualify, and the co-signer was the applicant's spouse, the original applicant must be given the opportunity to substitute a different creditworthy person as signer of such instrument if he/she wishes to do so. The Bank shall promptly notify the Regional Director of any instances in which the Bank, having received a response to a Stage 1 Letter saying that the signature of one or more of the joint owners was required by a Bank officer or employee, determined not to send a Stage 2 Letter. The response shall identify the underlying loan transaction involved, and an explanation of the Bank's reason for making its determination, in order to assist FDIC in determining whether the determination not to send a Stage 2 Letter was consistent with the obligations imposed by this paragraph 7.  8. Within 30 days of the effective date of this ORDER the Bank's Board of Directors shall establish, implement, and maintain revised procedures which provide that the Bank, in the administration of its motor vehicle indirect lending program, ensures that the terms of all acquired retail installment sales of motor vehicle contracts properly include all applicable charges, defined by applicable laws or regulations as finance charges, in the calculation of the finance charge, the amount financed, and the annual percentage rate disclosed to the consumer. The revised procedures shall necessarily address and ensure that in any transaction in which a document preparation fee, or any similar fee, is collected in a retail installment sale of motor vehicle contract either purchased or acquired by the Bank, such fee shall be included in the finance charge for the purpose of determining the annual percentage rate in accordance with the twenty-one percent limitation set forth by Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255B, section 14.  9. Within 120 days of the effective date of this ORDER, the Bank shall correct all other violations of law as described on pages 92-102 in the FDIC Report and on pages 24-44 of the Division's Report, and implement procedures to prevent their recurrence.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE BROKER LICENSING  Docket No. 2004-021  FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  MICHAEL KIM  d/b/a 123goloan.com  Burlington, Massachusetts  Mortgage Broker License No. MB2011  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that MICHAEL KIM, d/b/a 123goloan.com (""Michael Kim"" or the ""Sole Proprietor""), located at 2 Hallmark Gardens, Unit 6, Burlington, Massachusetts 01803 has engaged, or is engaged in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""TEMPORARY ORDER"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  Michael Kim is, and at all relevant times, has been a sole proprietor doing business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Michael Kim is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage broker as required by Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. The Commissioner issued Michael Kim's initial license to engage in the business of a mortgage broker at 681 Main Street, Waltham, Massachusetts 02451 on October 5, 2000, according to records maintained on file with the Division.  Through the submission of completed mortgage broker license renewal applications by Michael Kim and the resultant review and approval by the Commissioner, Michael Kim's mortgage broker license, number MB2011, renewed annually between June 2001 and June 2003.  On or about December 15, 2003, the Division received written notification from Michael Kim indicating his intent to relocate the licensed mortgage broker business to 2 Hallmark Gardens, Unit #6, Burlington, Massachusetts 01803. According to the written notification, the relocation was to be effective immediately and completed by January 2, 2004. Enclosed with the written notification was Michael Kim's original mortgage broker license certificate which had previously been renewed by the Commissioner on June 4, 2003 for the period ending May 31, 2004.  On or about January 29, 2004, the Commissioner issued an amended mortgage broker license certificate to Michael Kim which reflected Michael Kim's new licensed location at 2 Hallmark Gardens, Unit #6, Burlington, Massachusetts 01803. The new address appeared above the Commissioner's signature on the lower right quarter of the license certificate. A copy of the amended mortgage broker license certificate is attached as Exhibit A.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 5 states, in part, that, ""Such license shall not be transferrable or assignable and shall expire annually on June first.""  On March 26, 2004, Michael Kim submitted to the Division a License Renewal Application (the ""Renewal Application"") to renew his Massachusetts mortgage broker license, number MB2011, for the period ending May 31, 2005.  On June 1, 2004, Michael Kim's mortgage broker license, number MB2011, was set to expire in accordance with the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 5.  On July 1, 2004, an informal conference, attended by Michael Kim and certain members of the Division's staff, was held at the Division's office located at One South Station, 3  rd  Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02110. The informal conference was held by the Division to address certain matters which were of significant concern to the Division and which were preventing a determination on the Renewal Application. The Division's concerns originated from a complaint that was filed with the Division against Michael Kim on or about March 13, 2004.  As of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, the Commissioner had neither approved nor denied the Renewal Application and, therefore, had not issued a mortgage broker license to Michael Kim for the period ending May 31, 2005.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 30A, section 13 states, in part, that, ""If a licensee has, in accordance with any law and with agency regulations, made timely and sufficient application for a renewal, his license shall not expire until his application has been finally determined by the agency.""  On July 20, 2004, the Division received a written request from a licensed Massachusetts mortgage lender (the ""Mortgage Lender"") in which the Mortgage Lender sought to confirm the status of Michael Kim as a licensed mortgage broker in Massachusetts and to determine the authenticity of an enclosed copy of a mortgage broker license certificate that had been presented to the Mortgage Lender. A copy of the mortgage broker license certificate presented to the Mortgage Lender is attached hereto as Exhibit B (the """"Presented License"").  On July 20, 2004, by a separate letter to the Division [inaccurately dated as of February 13, 2004], the Mortgage Lender informed the Division that the Mortgage Lender's standard business practice is to request that all mortgage brokers and correspondents conducting business with the Mortgage Lender provide proof that such party possesses a current mortgage broker license. The Mortgage Lender further informed the Division by such letter that in response to this request for proof of his current licensing status in Massachusetts, Michael Kim provided the Mortgage Lender with the Presented License.  Prior to July 20, 2004, the Presented License was not contained in the Division's records and files maintained for Michael Kim.  The Presented License contains certain indicia which permits the Commissioner to find with certainty that the Presented License was neither printed nor issued by the Division. These indicia, which are inconsistent with the standard format used by the Division, include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:  An issuance date listed as May 28, 2004. As indicated in Section 10 of this TEMPORARY ORDER, the Commissioner had neither approved nor denied the Renewal Application and, therefore, had not issued a mortgage broker license to Michael Kim for the period ending May 31, 2005;  The word processing font used to complete the Presented License. The Division's standard practice is to complete all mortgage broker and mortgage lender license certificates using a standard font commonly identified as 'Arial.' The Presented License is completed using an unidentified font which is not the 'Arial' font used by the Division;  The licensed address appearing on the Presented License. As indicated in Section 5 of this TEMPORARY ORDER, the Commissioner issued an amended mortgage broker license certificate on January 29, 2004 to reflect the change in the licensed location maintained by Michael Kim. The updated licensed location appeared on the lower quarter of the license certificate. As of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, the Commissioner has never issued a mortgage broker license certificate to Michael Kim in which the 2 Hallmark Gardens, Unit #6, Burlington, Massachusetts 01803 location appeared in the space routinely reserved on the license certificate for identifying the licensed location. The Presented License includes the 2 Hallmark Gardens, Unit #6, Burlington, Massachusetts 01803 location in such space routinely reserved on the license certificate for identifying the licensed location;  The expiration date appearing on the Presented License. The Division's standard practice is to include the license expiration date in a larger font size than that used to complete other information on the license certificate. The font size and spacing of the license expiration date appearing on the Presented License suggest that the Presented License was not completed by the Division; and  The signatures of the Commissioner(s) appearing on the Presented License. Thomas J. Curry completed his service to the Division in the capacity of Commissioner on or about December 30, 2003. While any license certificate amended between December 30, 2003 and the end of the relevant licensing period on May 31, 2004 would continue to reflect the signature of former Commissioner Thomas J. Curry, any original mortgage broker license certificate issued for the period ending May 31, 2005 would include the signature of the current Commissioner of Banks, Steven L. Antonakes, exclusively. The Presented License, purported to have been issued by the Commissioner on May 28, 2004 for the period ending May 31, 2005, contains a copy of former Commissioner Thomas J. Curry's signature.  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 1 through 15, Michael Kim has conducted business as a mortgage broker in Massachusetts with a license that was not obtained from the Commissioner in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 1 through 15, Michael Kim has violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 by infringing upon the exclusive authority of the Commissioner to issue a license to engage in the business of a mortgage broker in Massachusetts.  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 1 through 15, Michael Kim has engaged in conduct which may violate Massachusetts General Laws chapter 267, section 1 by falsely making, altering, or forging a public record with the intent to defraud the Mortgage Lender.  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 1 through 15, Michael Kim has engaged in conduct which may violate Massachusetts General Laws chapter 267, section 5 by uttering and publishing as true a false, altered, or forged mortgage broker license certificate which Michael Kim knew to be false, altered, or forged with the intent to defraud the Mortgage Lender.  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 1 through 15, Michael Kim has engaged in conduct which may violate Massachusetts General Laws chapter 264, section 5 by using a representation of the great seal of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without approval from the Commissioner, for a commercial purpose in the conduct of his mortgage broker business.  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 1 through 15, Michael Kim has engaged in conduct which may violate Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) by engaging in the unfair or deceptive act or practice of falsely making, altering, or forging a public record to represent or imply that, as of May 28, 2004, the Commissioner had issued a mortgage broker license certificate to Michael Kim to engage in the business of a mortgage broker for the period ending May 31, 2005.  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 1 through 15, the Commissioner has determined that:  Michael Kim has engaged, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that he is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage broker including, but not limited to, the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. ; and  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to Michael Kim.  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 1 through 15, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of Michael Kim's original mortgage broker license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license.  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that Michael Kim, and any and all employees, independent contractors, or agents operating on behalf of Michael Kim's sole proprietorship, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of a mortgage broker, as defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this TEMPORARY ORDER. Therefore, Michael Kim is ordered to immediately cease soliciting or accepting, either directly or indirectly, any residential mortgage loan applications from consumers for residential property located in Massachusetts.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Michael Kim shall immediately place any fees previously collected from Massachusetts consumers relative to any pending mortgage loan applications in a separate escrow account maintained at a federally insured bank.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Michael Kim shall place his entire open application list to a qualified lender with no loss to applicants. The open application list to be placed with a qualified lender shall include all transactions in which Michael Kim was performing in the capacity of a mortgage broker.

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Michael Kim shall submit to the Commissioner a detailed record of all of his pending residential mortgage loan applications on property located in Massachusetts. The records to be produced shall be submitted to the Commissioner within five (5) days of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER and shall include all information on file, regarding Michael Kim's open application list, including but not necessarily limited to, the following:  The names of all individuals from whom Michael Kim has accepted an application for a residential mortgage loan; the applicants' addresses and telephone numbers; the amount of all prepaid loan fees submitted by the customer; the amount of each loan; application status (i.e. filed, submitted to lenders, cleared to close, etc.); scheduled closing dates; and a list identifying the applicable lender with whom the applicants' application was placed. The latter list should include telephone numbers of contact persons familiar with Michael Kim's submitted loans.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Michael Kim shall immediately secure all pending mortgage loan application files and, to the extent that any original documents must be forwarded to the relevant mortgage lender pursuant to Section 26 of this TEMPORARY ORDER, a copy of such document, correspondence, or paper relating to the mortgage loan shall be retained in Michael Kim's books and records and shall be available to the Commissioner, in their entirety, upon request.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this TEMPORARY ORDER shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 30A.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such TEMPORARY ORDER shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from Michael Kim within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER. If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this TEMPORARY ORDER shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.

According to the Mortgage Broker Annual Report for the Year Ended December 31, 2003 which was submitted to the Division by Mulberry Mortgage on March 5, 2004, MARK L. MCCARTHY has been employed by Mulberry Mortgage, on a part-time basis, since March 1, 2002.  On September 2, 2004, a federal Grand Jury, impaneled in the United States District Court, District of Massachusetts, returned an indictment against ten individuals (the ""Defendants"") charging them with sixty-two counts of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to launder money arising out of their participation in a multi-million dollar mortgage fraud scheme. The individuals charged in the Grand Jury indictment included THEODORE C. JARRETT, JR. and MARK L. MCCARTHY.  The charges set forth in the Grand Jury indictment allege that the Defendants participated in a scheme of purchasing distressed properties and thereafter rapidly reselling such properties at artificially inflated values, a practice generally referred to as 'land flipping.' The execution of the 'land flipping' scheme was supported, in part, by the origination and processing of false and fraudulent loan applications through various lending institutions to obtain loans for prospective buyers and by the generation of false and fraudulent income information that artificially inflated the true income of prospective buyers.  On September 23, 2004, the United States Attorney's Office issued a Press Release which announced the return of the above indictment and that the ten individuals charged therein had been arrested as of September 23, 2004. (  Ten Individuals Indicted for Participation in Multi-Million Dollar Mortgage Fraud Scheme in Springfield , Press Release, United States Attorney's Office, District of Massachusetts, September 23, 2004.) The Press Release further identified the roles of THEODORE C. JARRET, JR. and MARK L. MCCARTHY in the alleged scheme as having both worked in the mortgage business and having assisted in finding financing for prospective buyers.(See  id.  at 2.)  On September 24, 2004, an article appearing in  The Republican , Springfield [Massachusetts] Edition newspaper described the arrests of the Defendants and the nature of the allegations set forth by the Grand Jury indictment. The newspaper article was observed by a Division examiner and was reported to management personnel of the Division for review by the latter.  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.12(1)(b) states, in part, that:  (1) [A] Licensee shall notify the Commissioner immediately, and in writing within one business day, of the occurrence of any of the following significant developments: . . . (b) [F]iling of a criminal indictment any way related to the mortgage lender or brokerage activities of a Licensee, including but not limited to, the handling and/or reporting of moneys received and/or instruments sold.  As of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, the Division has not received notification from Mulberry Mortgage of the occurrence of the events referenced above in Sections 6 and 7 of this TEMPORARY ORDER.  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 1 through 11, the charges set forth in the Grand Jury indictment referenced in Section 6 of this TEMPORARY ORDER are related to the licensed activities conducted by THEODORE C. JARRETT, JR., MARK L. MCCARTHY, and MULBERRY MORTGAGE COMPANY, INC. under the Corporation's mortgage broker license numbers MB2414, MB2508, and MB3487.  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 1 through 11, Mulberry Mortgage failed to notify the Commissioner in writing, within one business day, that a criminal indictment had been filed against THEODORE C. JARRETT, JR., and MARK L. MCCARTHY in the United States District Court, District of Massachusetts, in violation of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12(1)(b).  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 1 through 11, THEODORE C. JARRETT, JR., MARK L. MCCARTHY, and MULBERRY MORTGAGE COMPANY, INC. have failed to demonstrate the character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 1 through 11, the Commissioner has determined that:  (a) THEODORE C. JARRETT, JR., MARK L. MCCARTHY, and MULBERRY MORTGAGE COMPANY, INC. have engaged, or are about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that they are not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage broker including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. ; and  (b) The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to THEODORE C. JARRETT, JR., MARK L. MCCARTHY, and MULBERRY MORTGAGE COMPANY, INC.  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 1 through 11, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of Mulberry Mortgage's original mortgage broker license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in paragraphs 1 through 11 present sufficient grounds for the revocation of Mulberry Mortgage's mortgage broker licenses, numbers MB2414, MB2508, and MB3487, pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.07(2)(b)(1).  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that THEODORE C. JARRETT, JR., MARK L. MCCARTHY, and MULBERRY MORTGAGE COMPANY, INC., and any and all employees, independent contractors, or agents operating on behalf of Mulberry Mortgage, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of a mortgage broker, as defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this TEMPORARY ORDER.

The open application list to be placed with a qualified lender shall include all transactions in which the Corporation was performing in the capacity of a mortgage broker. MULBERRY MORTGAGE COMPANY, INC. shall obtain the prior approval of the Commissioner before placing such applications to the qualified lender.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that MULBERRY MORTGAGE COMPANY, INC. shall submit to the Commissioner a detailed record, prepared as of the date of submission, of all of the Corporation's pending residential mortgage loan applications on property located in Massachusetts.

JARRETT, JR., MARK L. MCCARTHY, and MULBERRY MORTGAGE COMPANY, INC. have accepted an application for a residential mortgage loan; the applicants' addresses and telephone numbers; the amount of all prepaid loan fees submitted by the customer; the amount of each loan; application status (i.e. filed, submitted to lenders, cleared to close, etc.); scheduled closing dates; and a list identifying the applicable lender with whom the applicants' application was placed. The latter list should include telephone numbers of contact persons familiar with the Corporation's submitted loans.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that MULBERRY MORTGAGE COMPANY, INC. shall immediately secure all pending mortgage loan application files and, to the extent that any original documents must be forwarded to the relevant mortgage lender pursuant to Section 19 of this TEMPORARY ORDER, a copy of such document, correspondence, or paper relating to the mortgage loan shall be retained in the Corporation's books and records and shall be available to the Commissioner, in their entirety, upon request.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this TEMPORARY ORDER shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 30A.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such TEMPORARY ORDER shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from THEODORE C. JARRETT, JR., MARK L. MCCARTHY, and MULBERRY MORTGAGE COMPANY, INC. within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER.

The contractual relationships established and maintained with vendors at the additional licensed locations, other than the Corporation's main office, shall be entered in the name of New England Merchants, the licensee. The expenses referenced in this Section of the ORDER shall include, but shall not be limited to, expenses arising from the leasing, renting, or ownership of the licensed premises, telephones, utilities, advertising, marketing, any third party mortgage-related fees such as title, appraisal, and credit report fees, and any capital expenses incurred at the additional licensed location.

The provisions of this subsection of the ORDER shall necessarily prohibit any such qualifying independent contractor from employing, or otherwise compensating, any other natural person or legal entity to engage in the licensed business on behalf of either the independent contractor or New England Merchants as such person or entity would be required to separately obtain the relevant license from the Commissioner.

Any funds advanced to a branch operator employee, loan originator employee, or other employee shall be reported on the Corporation's financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles when submitted to the Division;  The Corporation shall provide the Division with a written summary, completed in reasonable detail, which describes the general duties to be performed on New England Merchants' behalf, for compensation or gain, by any person(s) attempting to assist the Corporation in negotiating, placing, making, or finding a mortgage loan on residential property located in Massachusetts who is not primarily conducting such activities from a licensed location maintained by New England Merchants. The summary shall include, but shall not necessarily be limited to, any employee or independent contractor associated with New England Merchants who conducts such activity from the individual's own residence;  New England Merchants shall adopt or revise, as applicable, quality control standards contained in policies and procedures that will ensure that branch operators, loan originators, and other employees operating on behalf of New England Merchants are adequately supervised to ensure compliance with all state and federal laws and regulations applicable to those engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts.

The sworn statements, set forth and attested to in the Affidavit, allege, in part, that MARIO VIANA and JULIO VIANA operated an unlicensed money transmitting business, during the relevant time period beginning on or about January 6, 2004 until July 21, 2004, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1960(a).  The sworn statements, set forth and attested to in the Affidavit, allege, in part, that that JULIO VIANA structured transactions to evade transaction reporting requirements in violation of 31 U.S.C. § 5324(a)(3).  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 1 through 9, Vigo Remittance Corporation possesses the authority granted under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169, section 12 to surrender foreign transmittal agency license number FT3874.  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 1 through 9, MARIO VIANA, JULIO VIANA, and FAMILY MARKET, as of June 29, 2005, are no longer authorized, either individually or collectively, to engage in the business of a foreign transmittal agency in Massachusetts on behalf of Vigo Remittance Corporation under license number FT3874.  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 1 through 9, MARIO VIANA, JULIO VIANA, and FAMILY MARKET are not otherwise exempted from the licensing requirements of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169, section 6 for those engaged in the business of a foreign transmittal agency in Massachusetts.  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 1 through 9, the alleged facts set forth in the Affidavit referenced in Paragraph 5 of this TEMPORARY ORDER are related to the conduct of the business of a foreign transmittal agency in Massachusetts.  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 1 through 9, the Commissioner has determined that:  MARIO VIANA, JULIO VIANA, and FAMILY MARKET have failed to demonstrate the character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the business has been, is, or will be operated honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in accordance with the standards governing the licensing and conduct of a foreign transmittal agency including, but not limited to, the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169, section 6, and the Division&apos;s regulations at 209 CMR 44.00  et seq. ; and  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an  		ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST against MARIO VIANA, JULIO VIANA, and FAMILY MARKET.  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 1 through 9, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of Vigo Remittance Corporation&apos;s original foreign transmittal agency license application for the 47 Main Street, Peabody, Massachusetts location, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in paragraphs 1 through 9, if finally determined, would present sufficient grounds for the revocation of Vigo Remittance Corporation&apos;s foreign transmittal agency license, number FT3874, pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169, section 12 and the Division&apos;s regulation at 209 CMR 44.04(2)(b)(1).  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that MARIO VIANA, JULIO VIANA, and FAMILY MARKET, and any and all employees, independent contractors, or agents operating on behalf of FAMILY MARKET, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease and thereafter desist from engaging in the activities of a foreign transmittal agency, as defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169, section 6, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this TEMPORARY ORDER. Therefore, MARIO VIANA, JULIO VIANA, and FAMILY MARKET shall not accept or receive any deposits of money from Massachusetts consumers for the purpose of transmitting the same, or equivalents thereof, to a foreign location.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that MARIO VIANA, JULIO VIANA, and FAMILY MARKET, shall immediately effect the transmittal of any amounts deposited by a Massachusetts consumer and held by FAMILY MARKET as of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER in accordance with the standards set forth in Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169, section 6, and the Division&apos;s regulations at 209 CMR 44.00  et seq.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that MARIO VIANA, JULIO VIANA, and FAMILY MARKET, shall provide the Division, within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, a complete record of all monies received and transmitted by MARIO VIANA, JULIO VIANA, and FAMILY MARKET during the period from April 13, 2005 through the effective date of this ORDER. The records to be produced shall include, but are not limited to, the names and addresses of all individuals who have deposited money for the purpose of transmitting the same or equivalents thereof to foreign countries, the amount of each transmittal, the transaction numbers, and the total fees charged on each transaction.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this TEMPORARY ORDER shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 30A.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such TEMPORARY ORDER shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from MARIO VIANA, JULIO VIANA, and FAMILY MARKET within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER. If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this TEMPORARY ORDER shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE LENDER AND  MORTGAGE BROKER LICENSING  Docket No. 2005-019  FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  MATRIX INVESTMENT CORPORATION,  Groton, Connecticut  Mortgage Lender and Mortgage Broker License No. MC1103  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that MATRIX INVESTMENT CORPORATION (""Matrix Investment"" or the ""Corporation""), located at 618 Poquonnock Road, Groton, Connecticut 06340 has engaged, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""TEMPORARY ORDER"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and/or a mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  Matrix Investment is, and at all relevant times, has been a corporation doing business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Matrix Investment is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage lender and mortgage broker as required by Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. Matrix Investment engages in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker at 618 Poquonnock Road, Groton, Connecticut. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner issued Matrix Investment's initial license to engage in the business of a mortgage lender on March 23, 1999. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner issued Matrix Investment's initial license to engage in the business of a mortgage broker on November 16, 2000. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner issued Matrix Investment's combined mortgage lender and mortgage broker license on June 1, 2003, with license number MC1103.  Matrix Investment has refinanced at least two (2) mortgage loans secured residential property in Massachusetts in which Matrix Investment agreed to fund, but failed to timely disburse the loan proceeds.  On July 29, 2005, the State of Connecticut Department of Banking suspended Matrix Investment's licenses to engage in the business of making first and secondary mortgage loans and to act as a first and secondary mortgage broker in Connecticut pursuant to an Order of Summary Suspension, Notice of Intent to Revoke First Mortgage Correspondent Lender/Broker and Secondary Mortgage Correspondent Lender/Broker Licenses, Notice of Intent to Issue Order to Cease and Desist, Notice of Intent to Impose Civil Penalty and Notice of Right to Hearing (""Connecticut Order"").  The Connecticut Order states that the Connecticut Banking Commissioner has reason to believe that Matrix Investment engaged in conduct that would constitute grounds to revoke the Corporation's licenses, including, but not limited to, failure to perform written agreements with a borrower.  On July 25, 2005, the New York Banking Department suspended Matrix Investment's mortgage banking license for a period of 30 days. According to the State of New York Banking Department Weekly Bulletin, dated July 29, 2005, ""The [NY] Superintendent finds that Matrix Investment has defaulted in performing its financial obligations and has engaged in dishonest or inequitable practices that have caused substantial harm to the persons afforded the protection or Article 12-D.""  According to information obtained by the Division from Mr. Marty Weiss a representative of National City, National City suspended Matrix Investment's warehouse line of credit as of July 26, 2005 at 2:00 pm.  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.12(1)(b) states, in part:  A Licensee shall notify the Commissioner immediately, and in writing within one business day, of the occurrence of any of the following significant developments: . . .(e) Expiration, termination or default, technical or otherwise, of any existing line of credit or warehouse credit agreement.  As of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, the Division has not received notification from Matrix Investment of the occurrence of the events referenced above in Section 7 of this TEMPORARY ORDER.  On or about October 17, 2003, the Connecticut Department of Labor, a regulatory agency of the State of Connecticut, assessed civil penalties against Matrix Investment for violations of the Connecticut General Statutes relating to record keeping, payment of wages and payment of overtime.  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.12(1)(c) states, in part:  A Licensee shall notify the Commissioner immediately, and in writing within one business day, of the occurrence of any of the following significant developments: . . . (c) [R]eceiving notification of . . . formal or informal regulatory action, in any state against the Licensee, and the reasons thereof.  On March 5, 2004 the Division received Matrix Investment's renewal application for the license period of June 1, 2004 through May 31, 2005, in which the Corporation answered ""no"" to question number 10, which asks, in part, ""In the past twelve (12) months, has any governmental or regulatory agency ever initiated an informal or formal regulatory action or order against the applicant? . . .""  As of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, the Division has not received notification from Matrix Investment of the occurrence of the events referenced above in Section 10 of this TEMPORARY ORDER.  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 1 through 13, MATRIX INVESTMENT CORPORATION has failed to demonstrate the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 1 through 13, Matrix Investment failed to notify the Commissioner in writing, within one business day, that the Corporation was the subject of a regulatory action instituted by the Connecticut Department of Labor, in violation of 209 CMR 42.12(1)(c).  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 1 through 13, Matrix Investment failed to notify the Commissioner in writing, within one business day that National City suspended Matrix Investment's warehouse line of credit, in violation of 209 CMR 42.12(1)(e).  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 1 through 13, the Commissioner has determined that:  MATRIX INVESTMENT CORPORATION has engaged, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that it is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage lender including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. ; and  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to MATRIX INVESTMENT CORPORATION.  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 1 through 13, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of Matrix Investment's original mortgage lender license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in paragraphs 1 through 13 present sufficient grounds for the revocation of Matrix Investment's mortgage lender license number MC1103 pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.04(2)(b) and 209 CMR 42.07(2)(b).  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that MATRIX INVESTMENT CORPORATION and any and all employees, independent contractors, or agents operating on behalf of Matrix Investment, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of a mortgage lender or broker, as defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this TEMPORARY ORDER. Therefore, MATRIX INVESTMENT CORPORATION IS ordered to immediately cease soliciting or accepting, either directly or indirectly, any residential mortgage loan applications from consumers for residential property located in Massachusetts.

The open application list to be placed with a qualified lender shall include all transactions in which the Corporation was performing in the capacity of either a mortgage lender or a mortgage broker. MATRIX INVESTMENT CORPORATION shall obtain the prior approval of the Commissioner before placing such applications to the qualified lender.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that MATRIX INVESTMENT CORPORATION shall submit to the Commissioner a detailed record, prepared as of the date of submission, of all of the Corporation's pending residential mortgage loan applications on property located in Massachusetts. The records to be produced shall be submitted to the Commissioner within five (5) days of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER and shall include all information on file, regarding the Corporation's open application list, including but not necessarily limited to, the following:  All information on file as of the date of submission regarding Matrix Investment's open application pipeline as a mortgage lender, including but not limited to, the following: The names of all individuals from whom MATRIX INVESTMENT CORPORATION have accepted an application for a residential mortgage loan; the applicants' addresses and telephone numbers; the amount of all prepaid loan fees submitted by the customer; the amount of each loan; application status (i.e. filed, submitted to lenders, cleared to close, etc.); scheduled closing dates; and a list identifying the applicable lender with whom the applicants' application was placed. The latter list should include telephone numbers of contact persons familiar with the Corporation's submitted loans.  Matrix Investment's balance sheet and year-to-date income statement as of the date of submission.

Quotemearate's main office is located at 10333 Harwin Drive, Suite 425, Houston, Texas.  Quotemearate is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued mortgage broker license number MB 3208 to Quotemearate to engage in the business of a mortgage broker at 10333 Harwin Drive, Suite 425, Houston, Texas on September 30, 2003.  Quotemearate maintains additional office locations from which the Corporation conducts the mortgage broker business. According to records maintained on file with the Division, Quotemearate currently possesses thirty-four (34) additional mortgage broker licenses from the Commissioner for locations operated both in Massachusetts as well as outside the Commonwealth.  Mortgage brokers in Massachusetts are licensed and regulated under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, which is administered and enforced by the Commissioner. Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division is authorized to inspect the books, accounts, papers, records, and files of mortgage brokers transacting business in Massachusetts to determine compliance with the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E or any rule, or regulation issued thereunder, and with any law, rule, or regulation applicable to the conduct of the business of a mortgage broker.  On October 12, 2005, pursuant to the authority granted under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division commenced an examination/inspection of the books, accounts, papers, records, and files maintained by Quotemearate to evaluate the Corporation's compliance with the laws, regulations, and regulatory bulletins applicable to the conduct of a mortgage broker business in Massachusetts (the ""2005 examination/inspection""). 	 A. Undisclosed Points and Fees  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2005 examination/inspection indicate that the Corporation engaged in a pattern or practice of understatements or omissions regarding the fees charged to consumers by Quotemearate.  The Corporation's books and records indicate that origination fees, broker fees, processing fees, and application fees (collectively, ""broker fees"") were collected at the loan closing in amounts which were not previously disclosed to consumers, in writing, to the extent charged at closing, if at all.  The omitted or understated portion of the broker fees collected from consumers at the loan closing varied in the loan files reviewed by the Division's examiners, but in some cases amounted to several thousand dollars. 	 B. Commingling Consumer Funds in the Operating Accounts Maintained for the Corporation  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2005 examination/inspection indicate that the Corporation failed to deposit funds received from consumers prior to loan closing into a designated trust account at certain unlicensed locations. The consumers' deposits were commingled with the Corporation's funds in Quotemearate's business operation accounts. 	 C. Engaging in the Mortgage Broker Business in Massachusetts from a Network of Unlicensed Locations  According to records maintained on file at the Division, Quotemearate submitted license applications to the Division at various times during 2005 to obtain licenses from the Commissioner to conduct the mortgage broker business at the seventeen (17) additional locations identified in Exhibit 1, as attached hereto, and incorporated by reference.  As of the date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, the Commissioner has not approved Quotemearate's license applications to engage in the business of a mortgage broker at any of the office locations referenced in Paragraph 11.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2005 examination/inspection indicate that Quotemearate conducted the mortgage broker business at twelve (12) of the unlicensed office locations listed in Paragraph 11, beginning on a specific date that is unknown to the Division, but continuing at least until the date of the 2005 examination/inspection. See Exhibit 1.  In addition to the seventeen (17) additional locations referenced in Paragraph 11, the records provided by the Corporation during the 2005 examination/inspection indicated that Quotemearate conducted the mortgage broker business, during the relevant times, from at least thirty (30) additional unlicensed office locations, for which Quotemearate failed to provide notice to the Commissioner, submit a license application, or receive approval from the Commissioner to engage in the mortgage broker business from such locations. See Exhibit 2.  During the 2005 examination/inspection, Quotemearate's management indicated that individuals performing in the capacity of branch managers of the unlicensed office locations were authorized by Quotemearate to conduct business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts using mortgage broker license MB3208 which, as indicated above, had been issued for the Houston, Texas office location.  Documents included in the Division's records indicate that Quotemearate's Branch Licensing Coordinator specifically authorized branch managers of unlicensed office locations to conduct business in Massachusetts without first obtaining additional licenses from the Commissioner to engage in the mortgage broker business at those locations. See Exhibit 3.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2005 examination/inspection indicate that the Corporation further failed to notify the Division of the relocation of various branch offices. 	 D. Engaging in the Mortgage Broker Business in Massachusetts Under the Direction of a Network of Unapproved Branch Managers  Information routinely requested by the Division, in advance, from an individual seeking to perform in the capacity of a branch manager is sought so that the Division can determine whether the individual, as a principal employee, possesses the responsibility, character, reputation, integrity and general fitness which would allow the Division to find that the licensed business will be operated honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest.  Documents included in the Division's records indicate that the Division had neither reviewed nor approved the branch managers responsible for operating the additional office locations listed in Paragraph 11.  Documents included in the Division's records indicate that the Division had neither reviewed nor approved the branch managers who were responsible for operating the additional office locations listed in Paragraph 14, as the Division had not received written notice or a license application from the Corporation indicating that Quotemearate intended to carry on the licensed business from the applicable locations. 	 E. Engaging Unauthorized Individuals to Originate Mortgage Loans in Massachusetts  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2005 examination/inspection indicated that Quotemearate, at all relevant times, retained several individuals in the capacity of independent contractors to conduct the mortgage broker business.  By prior published opinions, the Division has set forth the standards which an individual must satisfy, in advance, when seeking to operate in the capacity of an independent contractor associated with a licensed mortgage broker or mortgage lender under General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. The Division's published opinions have consistently held that the exemption from licensure referenced herein is available exclusively to individuals engaging in the licensed business in the name of the licensee and is not available to an independent corporation, partnership, association, or other legal entity that is separate and distinct from the legal entity in whose name the license was issued.  The Corporation's books and records failed to include any information that would illustrate that the independent contractors referenced in Paragraph 21 were either exempt from licensure under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E or that the individuals and Quotemearate had previously satisfied the qualifying standards for independent contractors set forth by the relevant opinions published by the Division. 	 F. Failure to Notify the Commissioner of the closing of Massachusetts office locations  The Division has obtained information indicating that the Corporation is in the process of suspending or terminating all business operations. See Exhibit 4. A representative of the Texas Savings and Loan Department (the ""Department"") indicated that the Department has reason to believe that Quotemearate has suspended all operations as of March 24, 2006.  The Corporation failed to provide the Division with prior written notice of the Corporation's intent to close its office locations. 	 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 25, Quotemearate is not an entity otherwise exempted from the licensing requirements of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2 for those engaged in the business of a mortgage broker in Massachusetts.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 25, Quotemearate has unlawfully engaged in the business of a mortgage broker through a network of locations and individuals operating without a license from the Commissioner in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, §2 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.00  et seq.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 25, Quotemearate has solicited or accepted residential mortgage loan applications for property located in Massachusetts from individuals engaging in the activity of a mortgage broker who were not employed by the Corporation and who otherwise failed to qualify for an exemption from licensure under the provisions of General Laws chapter 255E, section 2 as set forth by the Division by prior published opinions, including without limitation Opinions 96-221, 97-061, and 97-222.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 25, Quotemearate has commingled money deposited by consumers with the Corporation's own funds in violation of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.11.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 25, Quotemearate has charged loan fees, points, or similar fees in a mortgage transaction involving residential property located in the Commonwealth, of four or less units and occupied in whole or in part by the mortgagor, without previously disclosing such fees or points to the mortgagor in writing in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 183, section 63.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 25, by accepting points and fees which were not disclosed in accordance with Massachusetts General Laws chapter 183, section 63, Quotemearate engaged in the unfair and deceptive acts and practices in violation of the Office of the Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.06(12).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 25, Quotemearate carried on its business in locations other than the address on its original license without first notifying the Commissioner, in writing, at least thirty days prior to the opening of the branch location in violation of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.13(1).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 25, Quotemearate suspended business operations in Massachusetts locations without first notifying the Commissioner, in writing, at least thirty days prior to the closing of the Massachusetts locations in violation of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.13(2).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 25, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 Quotemearate has engaged, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that the Corporation is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage broker including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq.  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to Quotemearate.  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that Quotemearate, its officers, directors, employees, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of a mortgage broker, as defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, §1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this TEMPORARY ORDER.  ORDERED that Quotemearate, its officers, directors, employees, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in business relationships or affiliations with individuals retained as independent contractors to originate residential mortgage loans on behalf of the Corporation unless (a) such individuals are exempt from licensure under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2 by primarily engaging in the licensed business under the direction of the Corporation and (b) the Corporation and the individual have previously executed the Exemption Affidavit and Statement of Accountability and submitted such completed documents to the Division in accordance with the provisions previously set forth by the Division by published opinion. Any such independent contractor shall engage in the licensed activity exclusively in the name of Quotemearate. 	 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, that Quotemearate, its officers, directors, employees, and their successors or assigns, take the following affirmative actions:  Quotemearate shall immediately place any fees previously collected from Massachusetts consumers, relative to any pending mortgage loan applications accepted at any office location ordered to cease activity under the provisions of this TEMPORARY ORDER, into a separate escrow account, designated for such purpose and maintained at a federally insured bank. In addition, Quotemearate shall adopt or revise, as applicable, policies and procedures to ensure adherence to all regulations concerning the maintenance of such escrow account under 209 CMR 42.11.  Quotemearate shall transfer its entire open application list of all pending applications relating to Massachusetts residential property to a qualified lender with no loss to the applicants. 	 Quotemearate shall submit to the Commissioner a detailed record of all of the Corporation's pending residential mortgage loan applications transferred pursuant to this Paragraph of the TEMPORARY ORDER. The records to be produced shall be submitted to the Commissioner within ten (10) days of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER and shall include all information on file, including but not necessarily limited to, the following: 		 All information on file as of the date of submission regarding the Corporation's open application pipeline, including but not limited to the following: The names of all individuals from whom Quotemearate has accepted an application for a residential mortgage loan; the applicants' addresses and telephone numbers; the amount of all prepaid loan fees submitted by the customer; the amount of each loan; application status (i.e. filed, submitted to lenders); scheduled closing dates; and a list of applicable wholesale lenders. The latter list should include telephone numbers of contact persons familiar with Quotemearate's submitted loans.  Quotemearate shall immediately secure all pending residential mortgage loan application files and shall make such files, in their entirety, available to the Commissioner upon request.  The Corporation shall immediately take all necessary steps to review and revise the Corporation's policies and procedures to ensure that any loan fees, mortgage broker fees, application fees, processing fees, or similar fees collected as compensation for administrative costs incurred in originating the mortgage loan, are not charged to consumers except to the extent that such fees or points have been properly disclosed to the consumer, in writing, prior to the closing of the mortgage loan. 	 Within sixty (60) days of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, the Corporation shall cause to be made a review of all Massachusetts residential mortgage loans originated by Quotemearate since September 30, 2003 and shall identify all mortgage loan transactions in which the amount actually paid by the consumer as a loan fee, mortgage broker fee, application fee, or similar fee, as recorded on the settlement agreement, exceeded the amount disclosed to the consumer, in writing, for such fees prior to closing;  In each mortgage loan transaction identified pursuant to Paragraph 41(a), Quotemearate shall reimburse the consumer the difference between the actual charge assessed to the individual consumer as a loan fee, mortgage broker fee, processing fee, or similar fee and the amount disclosed in writing for such fees prior to closing;  Within sixty (60) days of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, Quotemearate shall submit to the Commissioner a list of all borrowers identified pursuant to the above described review of residential mortgage loan transactions to whom a reimbursement is owed by the Corporation in accordance with this Paragraph of the TEMPORARY ORDER;  Within ninety (90) days of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, Quotemearate shall submit evidence of all reimbursements issued to consumers pursuant to this Paragraph of the TEMPORARY ORDER, including the consumers' names, the dates the loans closed, check numbers, and the amount of the reimbursements; and  Quotemearate shall ensure that a system of internal controls is established to monitor the Corporation's compliance with the revised practices and procedures established and implemented pursuant to this Paragraph of the TEMPORARY ORDER.  Quotemearate shall refrain from engaging or retaining any separate corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other similar legal entity that conducts business as a mortgage lender or mortgage broker as an additional licensed location of the Corporation or allowing such entity to originate or broker residential mortgage loans under a license obtained from the Commissioner by the Corporation in the name of Quotemearate.  Quotemearate is directed to adopt or revise, as applicable, procedures and policies to ensure timely written notification to the Division of licensed branch relocations, closings, or of any event designated under the provisions of General Laws chapter 255E and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.13.  Within ten (10) days from the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, the Corporation shall submit a written report to the Commissioner which shall address and include a description of the form, content, and manner of all actions taken to address each Paragraph of this TEMPORARY ORDER and the results thereof. The written report shall be signed under the pains and penalties of perjury by a duly authorized senior officer of the Corporation.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this TEMPORARY ORDER shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under General Laws chapter 30A.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this TEMPORARY ORDER shall not be construed as approving any act, practice, or conduct not specifically set forth herein which was, is, or may be in violation of relevant state or federal laws and regulations. The findings, conclusions, and required action set forth in this TEMPORARY ORDER are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any findings, conclusions, and corrective action which may be set forth in the Report of Examination/Inspection, prepared by the Division of Banks as of October 12, 2005, and issued after the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such TEMPORARY ORDER shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from Quotemearate within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER. If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this TEMPORARY ORDER shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  FOREIGN TRANSMITTAL AGENCY LICENSING  No. 2006-016  FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  MILTON MIRANDA and EXPRESS REMITTANCE TRANSFER, LLC  Worcester, Massachusetts  Foreign Transmittal Agency License No. FT 3905  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that Milton Miranda, and Express Remittance Transfer, LLC, located at 557 West Boylston Street, Worcester, Massachusetts have engaged, or are engaged in, or are about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169, and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 44.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST pursuant to General Laws chapter 169, section 13(b).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons engaged in the business of a foreign transmittal agency pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169.  Milton Miranda, individually, is the owner/officer of Express Remittance Transfer, LLC (""ERT"" or the ""Company""). ERT's office, at which records for the Company are maintained, is located at 557 West Boylston Street, Worcester, Massachusetts.  ERT obtained the above-captioned license from the Division to operate as a foreign transmittal agency at 557 West Boylston Street, Worcester, Massachusetts on April 28, 2005.  Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169, section 10, the Division conducted an inspection of the books, accounts, papers, records, and files of ERT on June 20, 2006 (the ""examination/inspection"").  In reviewing ERT's records at the Company's office at 557 West Boylston Street, Worcester, Massachusetts, the Division's examiners concluded ERT has failed to preserve its books and records for transactions conducted by ERT as required by 209 CMR 44.05 . Specifically, ERT was unable or unwilling to provide customer information, dates of transactions, and amounts transmitted for customers.  ERT failed to provide the Company's interim financial statements including a balance sheet and income statement during the examination/inspection in order to permit the examiners to determine whether ERT continued to satisfy financial responsibility requirements contained in 209 CMR 44.03(2).  ERT failed to file its Annual Report with the Commissioner which was due to be submitted by January 31, 2006 as required by 209 CMR 44.06.  During the examination/inspection, ERT could not or would not provide evidence of compliance with the applicable provisions of 31 CFR 103, Financial Recordkeeping and Reporting of Currency and Foreign Transactions.  On June 21, 2006, ERT surrendered its foreign transmittal agency license by presenting the original license to the Division's examiners. ERT failed to deliver written notice of the surrender of its license, as required pursuant to General Laws chapter 169, section 12. 	 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based on the information contained in paragraphs 2 through 9, MILTON MIRANDA and EXPRESS REMITTANCE TRANSFER, LLC have failed to demonstrate the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the business will operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169, section 6 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 44.03.  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 2 through 9, MILTON MIRANDA and EXPRESS REMITTANCE TRANSFER, LLC, failed to report the volume of foreign transmittals conducted by the Company in an Annual Report required by the Division in order to determine the Company's bond requirement in violation of General Laws chapter 169, section 9 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 44.06.  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 2 through 9, MILTON MIRANDA and EXPRESS REMITTANCE TRANSFER, LLC failed to maintain records, sufficient to enable the Commissioner to determine the Company's level of compliance with the applicable rules and regulations pertaining to the conduct of a foreign transmittal agency, in violation of General Laws chapter 169, section 10 and 209 CMR 44.05.  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 2 through 9, MILTON MIRANDA and EXPRESS REMITTANCE TRANSFER, LLC., failed to produce complete and accurate trust account records in violation of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 44.07(3).  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 2 through 9, MILTON MIRANDA and EXPRESS REMITTANCE TRANSFER, LLC, have failed to demonstrate compliance with the applicable provisions of 31 CFR 103, Financial Recordkeeping and Reporting of Currency and Foreign Transactions  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 2 through 9, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 Express Remittance Transfer, LLC has engaged, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that the Company is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a foreign transmittal agency including, but not limited to, the provisions under General Laws chapter 169 and the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 44.00 et seq.  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to EXPRESS REMITTANCE TRANSFER, LLC.  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 2 through 9, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of EXPRESS REMITTANCE TRANSFER, LLC's original foreign transmittal agency license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. 	 ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that MILTON MIRANDA and EXPRESS REMITTANCE TRANSFER, LLC shall immediately cease from engaging directly or indirectly in the business of a foreign transmittal agency.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that MILTON MIRANDA and EXPRESS REMITTANCE, LLC shall provide the Division with a complete record of all monies received and transmitted domestically, foreign, or both during the period from its time of initial licensure of April 28, 2005 through the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER.

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that MILTON MIRANDA and EXPRESS REMITTANCE TRANSFER, LLC continue in full its bond with United Casualty and Surety Insurance Company, Bond Number MS1820, for $50,000 for one year from the date of the surrender of its license.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this TEMPORARY ORDER shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless set aside, limited or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review pursuant to General Laws chapter 30A.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such TEMPORARY ORDER shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from the Licensee within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER. If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this TEMPORARY ORDER shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.

The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST against BOSTON ENVIO, SANTO MELO, and JOSE GARCIA.  18. Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 1 through 13, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of Boston Envio's original foreign transmittal agency license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in paragraphs 1 through 10, if finally determined, would present sufficient grounds for the revocation of Boston Envio's foreign transmittal agency license, number FT0938, pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169, section 12 and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 44.04(2)(b)(1).  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  19. ORDERED that SANTO MELO, JOSE GARCIA and BOSTON ENVIO, and any and all employees, independent contractors, or agents operating on behalf of BOSTON ENVIO, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease and thereafter desist from engaging in the activities of a foreign transmittal agency, as defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169, section 6, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this TEMPORARY ORDER. Therefore, BOSTON ENVIO, SANTO MELO, and JOSE GARCIA are ordered to immediately cease accepting or receiving any deposits of money from Massachusetts consumers for the purpose of transmitting the same, or equivalents thereof, to a foreign location.  20. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that BOSTON ENVIO shall immediately effect the transmittal of any amounts deposited by Massachusetts consumers and held by Boston Envio as of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER in accordance with the standards set forth in Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169, section 6, and the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 44.00 et seq. Such transmissions shall be completed with no loss to the consumer.  21. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this TEMPORARY ORDER shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 30A.  22. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such TEMPORARY ORDER shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from BOSTON ENVIO, SANTO MELO, and JOSE GARCIA within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  DEBT COLLECTOR LICENSING  No. 2006-24  FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  GO-MORE FINANCIAL, INC.  Buffalo, Minnesota  Debt Collector License No. DC 0835  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that GO-MORE FINANCIAL, INC. (""Go-More"" or the ""Corporation""), located at 605 Highway 55E, Suite C Buffalo, Minnesota 55313 have engaged, or are engaged in, or are about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93, and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 18.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""TEMPORARY ORDER"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 93, section 24(J).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a debt collector in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93, section 24A.  Go-More is, and at all relevant times, has been a corporation doing business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Go-More is licensed by the Commissioner as a debt collector as required by Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93, section 24A. The Commissioner issued Go-More's initial license to engage in the business of a debt collector at 605 Highway 55E, Suite C Buffalo, MN 55313 on January 9, 2004, according to records maintained on file with the Division. The original license number is DC0835.  On August 30, 2006, the Division became aware that the Minnesota Department of Commerce issued a Notice of Revocation, Order for Revocation, Statement of Charges, and Notice of Right to Hearing to Go-More dated August 29, 2006 (the ""Minnesota Order"").  The Minnesota Order alleged that Go-More: 	 Commingled money collected for customers with Go-More's operating funds and used customer's money in the conduct of Go-More's business;  Falsified its records and filings with the intent to deceive governmental agencies;  Engaged in a pattern of financial mismanagement and misconduct that demonstrates they are untrustworthy, financially irresponsible, or otherwise incompetent or unqualified to act under the licenses granted by the Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Commerce;  Violated a June 19, 2006 Minnesota Consent Order executed on August 16, 2006 by implementing a financial decision in contradiction to the acting financial officer's directives, in violation of the provisions of the Consent Order and in violation of Minn. Stat. s. 45.027, subd 7(a)(2) and (4)(2004).  On August 30, the Division become aware that the State of Connecticut Department of Banking issued an Order of Summary Suspension, Notice of Intent to Revoke Consumer Collection Agency License, Notice of Intent to Issue Order to Cease and Desist, Notice of Intent to Impose Civil Penalty and Notice of Right to a Hearing dated August 29, 2006 (the ""Connecticut Order"").  The Connecticut Order states that the Connecticut Banking Commissioner has reason to believe that Go-More engaged in conduct that would constitute sufficient grounds to revoke the Corporation's license to act as within Connecticut as a consumer collection agency. Specifically, the Connecticut Order asserts that: 	 the Internal Revenue Service filed a federal tax lien against Go-More for nonpayment of federal taxes, in the amount of $482,808.06;  Go-More owes the Minnesota Department of Revenue unpaid withholding taxes in the amount of $24,433, plus penalties and interest; and  Go-more commingled money collected for creditors with its own funds, used creditors' money for the conduct of the Corporation's business and overdrew the trust fund established to hold money collected for creditors.  On August 30, 2006, the Division became aware that on August 28, 2006, the State of Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions Division of Banking denied Go-More's application for renewal of its collection agency license (the ""Wisconsin License Denial"").  The Findings set forth in the Wisconsin License Denial include the following: 	 Go-More violated a Wisconsin Consent Order, which was issued on November 14, 2005 and required financial reporting and maintenance of certain minimal net equity and net working capital;  Go-More failed to demonstrate financial responsibility;  Go-More failed to disclose certain disciplinary actions in its annual report;  Go-More entered into a Consent Order with the State of Minnesota, in which it was alleged that Go-More commingled client funds with operating accounts and otherwise operated in a manner hazardous to applicant's clients and the public;  Initial Audit Findings reported by the State of Minnesota indicate that Go-More does not have the required character and general fitness and financial responsibility;  The Minnesota Initial Audit Findings report revealed that Go-More owed the Internal Revenue Service approximately $554,000 as of June 26, 2006; and  Go-More failed to file the collection agency renewal application and pay the annual license fee prior to the statutory deadline.  On August 30, 2006, the Division became aware that on August 29, 2006, the State of Maine Department of Professional and Financial Regulation Office of Consumer Credit Regulation denied Go-More's renewal of its Maine Debt Collector License (the ""Maine License Denial"").  The Maine License Denial was based on the following factors: 	 Go-More failed to submit a renewal application;  Go-More failed to submit certain required financial documents in support of its 2005 renewal application, despite requests from the Maine Office of Consumer Credit Regulation; and  As of December 31, 2005, Go-More had a negative equity of over $162,000 and negative working capital of over $175,000. In addition, Go-More owes approximately $550,000 to the Internal Revenue Service and $24,000 to the Minnesota Department of Revenue in taxes.  On August 30, 2006, the Division became aware that, on August 28, 2006, the State of Colorado Department of Law Office of the Attorney General denied Go-More's application to renew its Colorado collection agency license (the ""Colorado License Denial"").  The Colorado License Denial was based on the following reasons: 	 Go-More provided false information in its renewal application regarding bank account information;  Go-More failed to notify the Colorado Department of changes in trust account information;  Go-More failed to maintain a positive net worth and owes the Internal Revenue Service approximately $550,000 and the Minnesota Department of Revenue approximately $30,000 in unpaid taxes;  Go-More failed to disclose legal, disciplinary, or administrative actions or proceedings by other state or regulatory authorities; and  Go-More entered into a Consent Order with the State of Minnesota, in which it was alleged that Go-More commingled client funds with operating accounts.  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR18.08(1) states, in part, that: 	 A Debt Collector, or registered third party loans servicer, if applicable shall notify the Commissioner immediately, and in writing within one business day, of the occurrence of any of the following significant developments: . . . (c) Notification of the institution of license denial, cease and desist, suspension or revocation procedures, or other formal or informal regulatory action, in any state against the debt collector or registered third party loan servicer, and the reasons thereof.  As of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, the Division has not received notification from GO-MORE of the occurrence of the events referenced above in Sections 3 through 13 of this TEMPORARY ORDER. 	 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 1 through 14, Go-More failed to notify the Commissioner in writing, within one business day, that its license had been revoked by the State of Minnesota, in violation of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 18.08(1)(c).  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 1 through 14, GO-MORE FINANCIAL SERVICES, Inc. has failed to demonstrate the character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93, section 24B (a) and the Division's regulation 209 CMR18.04 (2) (g)).  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 1 through 14, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 GO-MORE FINANCIAL, INC. has engaged, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that they are not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a debt collector including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 18.00  et seq. ; and  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to GO-MORE FINANCIAL, INC.  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 1 through 14, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of original debt collector license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in paragraphs 1 through 14 present sufficient grounds for the revocation of GO-MORE FINANCIAL, INC.'s debt collector license, number DC0835, pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93, section 24I. 	 ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that GO-MORE FINANCIAL, INC. and any and all employees, independent contractors, or agents operating on behalf of GO-MORE, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of a debt collector, as defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93 section 24, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this TEMPORARY ORDER. Therefore, GO-MORE FINANCIAL, INC. is ordered to immediately cease soliciting or accepting, either directly or indirectly, any third party debt collection accounts for any debtors located within Massachusetts.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that GO-MORE FINANCIAL, INC. shall immediately cease collecting any consumer collection accounts from debtors located within Massachusetts.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this TEMPORARY ORDER shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 30A.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such TEMPORARY ORDER shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from GO-MORE FINANCIAL, INC. within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER. If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this TEMPORARY ORDER shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE BROKER LICENSING  Docket No. 2006-026     FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  MIDDLESEX FINANCIAL ASSOCIATES LLC  D/B/A/ MIDDLESEX MORTGAGE CO.  Moultonboro, New Hampshire     Mortgage Broker License No. MB2720, MB3789 and MB3860  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that MIDDLESEX FINANCIAL ASSOCIATES LLC D/B/A/ MIDDLESEX MORTGAGE CO. (""Middlesex Financial"" or the ""Company""), with its main business office located at 91 Wyman Trail, Moultonboro, New Hampshire has engaged in, or is engaged in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""TEMPORARY ORDER"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  Middlesex Financial is, and at all relevant times, has been a company doing business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Middlesex Financial is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage broker as required by Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner issued Middlesex Financial's license number MB2720 to engage in the business of a mortgage broker at 91 Wyman Trail, Moultonboro, New Hampshire on June 10, 2001; license number MB3789 to engage in the business of a mortgage broker at 1160 Ocean Street, Unit 6, Marshfield, Massachusetts on February 7, 2005; and license number MB3860 to engage in the business of a mortgage broker at 62B Summer Street, Somerville, Massachusetts on March 23, 2005. The Company had previously surrendered seven licenses to engage in the business of a mortgage broker: MB1525, 18 Whittlemore Road, Newton, Massachusetts, which was surrendered in 2001; MB1799, 160 Old Derby Road, Room 223, Hingham, Massachusetts, which was surrendered in 2001; MB1845, 1758 Centre Street, West Roxbury, Massachusetts, which was surrendered in 2001; MB3751, 195 Concord Avenue, Framingham, Massachusetts, which was surrendered on August 29, 2006; MB4288, 123 Commercial Street, Lynn, Massachusetts, which was surrendered on August 29, 2006; MB2952, 1017 Turnpike Street, Suite 23, Canton, Massachusetts on September 20, 2006; and MB3788, 33 Riverside Drive, Suite 108, Pembroke, Massachusetts on September 20, 2006.  The Division received information suggesting that an office location of Middlesex Financial was maintained and operated by Kimthy Sin at an office location in Lowell, Massachusetts.  As of August 25, 2006, the Division's records did not reflect that Middlesex Financial had applied for, nor been approved by the Commissioner to conduct the mortgage broker business at the Lowell office location.  Two representatives of the Division conducted a visitation on August 25, 2006 of the unlicensed office in Lowell, Massachusetts and observed that mortgage broker activities were being conducted on the premises. Documents subsequently reviewed by the Division reflect that mortgage loan applications were being taken and processed in this unlicensed office. The Division's representative, through a discussion with Mr. Sin, confirmed that the latter was employed by Middlesex Financial. The General Manager of Middlesex Financial informed the Division that this individual was terminated by the Company on September 1, 2006.  On August 30, 2006, the Division conducted an on-site inspection of Middlesex Financial's licensed office location in Moultonboro, New Hampshire  ,  where all files are maintained (the ""on-site inspection""). On the next day, and during the following week, representatives of the Division also revisited the unlicensed office in Lowell.  In two mortgage transactions, applications taken on the same date and also subsequently closed on the same date by the same originator at the Framingham branch office, the Company misrepresented the number of units of the property to be mortgaged, misrepresented that the properties were to be the primary residence of the same individual, and failed to accurately represent that the same gross income would be applied to make payments on two separate loans on two separate properties. In a third mortgage transaction, applications taken one week apart and also subsequently closed 12 days apart by the same originator at the unlicensed Lowell office, the Company also misrepresented the number of units of the property to be mortgaged, misrepresented that the properties were to be the primary residence of the same individual, and failed to accurately represent that the same gross income would be applied to make payments on two separate loans on two separate properties. Examples include, but are not limited to the following documents, as summarized below: 	  (a) Loan #161948777 and Loan #921000316405: Borrower purchased two separate condominium units for $311,000.00 per unit. Both properties were listed as being purchased as the primary residence of the borrower on the loan applications. The loan applications were placed by Middlesex Financial with separate lenders. The applications were taken by the same originator on the same date, and were subsequently closed the following month on the same date. Each application placed by Middlesex Financial lists the number of units of the property to be mortgaged as three, but each property is a single unit. Each application uses the same amount of stated income and omits any reference or disclosure of the other mortgage loan application and/or liability. Enclosed as Exhibit A.  (b) Loan #3089966772 and Loan #189030: Borrower purchased two separate condominium units for $222,000.00 per unit. Both properties were listed as being purchased as the primary residence of the borrower on the loan applications. The loan applications were placed by Middlesex Financial with separate lenders. The applications were taken by the same originator on the same date, and were subsequently closed the following month on the same date. Each application placed by Middlesex Financial lists the number of units of the property to be mortgaged as three, but each property is a single unit. Each application uses the same amount of stated income and omits any reference or disclosure of the other mortgage loan application and/or liability. Enclosed as Exhibit B.  (c) Loan #928000086473 and Loan #0096559158: Borrower purchased a two family home for $300,000.00 and a single family home for $300,000.00. Both properties were listed as being purchased as the primary residence of the borrower on the loan applications. The loan applications were placed by Middlesex Financial with separate lenders. The applications were taken by the same originator on April 13, 2006 and April 20, 2006, and were subsequently closed April 21, 2006 and May 3, 2006, respectively. Each application uses the same amount of stated income and omits any reference or disclosure of the other mortgage loan application and/or liability. Enclosed as Exhibit C.  The loan applications referenced in Paragraph 8(a) and Paragraph 8(b) of this TEMPORARY ORDER were accepted and processed through Middlesex Financial's licensed office location in Framingham, Massachusetts, for which its license was subsequently surrendered. The loan applications referenced in Paragraph 8(c) of this TEMPORARY ORDER were accepted and processed through Middlesex Financial's unlicensed office location in Lowell, Massachusetts.  Middlesex Financial completed the loan applications referenced in Paragraph 8(a), Paragraph 8(b) and Paragraph 8(c) of this TEMPORARY ORDER, which contained false or misleading information relative to the number of units being purchased in the mortgaged properties, the number of units in each of the mortgaged properties, the designation as a primary residence of the mortgaged properties, and on the use of the same gross income to make payments on two separate loans on two separate properties.  Middlesex Financial knew or should have known that the property information reported, specifically the number of units being purchased, the number of units in each property, the mortgage liabilities of the applicant, and a designation as a primary residence would be relied upon in underwriting the mortgage loan by the mortgage lender or financial institution to which the mortgage loan applications were brokered by the Company.  Middlesex Financial knew or should have known that its participation in a pattern or practice of assisting in obtaining mortgage loans by submitting to the mortgage lender or financial institution misleading information relative to the conditioned and/or actual mortgage liability information of the applicant, as well as false information concerning the number of units being purchased, the number of units in each property, and the designation as a primary residence in mortgaged properties would be detrimental to the public interest. 	  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based on information contained in Paragraphs 1-12, Middlesex Financial was operating the business of a mortgage broker in Lowell, Massachusetts without a license, within the meaning of General Laws chapter 255E, section 5. Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 11, whenever the Commissioner finds that a licensee has violated any provisions of chapter 255E or any rule or regulation adopted thereunder, the Commissioner may impose a penalty which shall not exceed $5,000.00 for each violation.  Based on the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 12, Middlesex Financial has failed to demonstrate and maintain the character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the mortgage broker business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Divisions regulation 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).  Based on the information contained in Paragraph 1 through 12, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 (a) Middlesex Financial has engaged, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that it is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage broker including, but not limited to, the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. ; and  (b) The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to Middlesex Financial.  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that Middlesex Financial, and any and all employees, independent contractors, or agents operating on behalf of the Company, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of a mortgage broker, as defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this TEMPORARY ORDER. Therefore, Middlesex Financial is ordered to immediately cease soliciting or accepting, either directly or indirectly, any residential mortgage loan applications from consumers for residential property located in Massachusetts.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Middlesex Financial shall immediately place any fees previously collected from Massachusetts consumers relative to any pending mortgage loan applications in a separate escrow account maintained at a federally insured bank.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Middlesex Financial shall place all of its pending residential mortgage loan applications with a qualified broker or lender, as appropriate based on the status of the application, with no loss to applicants. The open application list shall include all transactions in which Middlesex Financial was performing in the capacity of a mortgage broker. Middlesex Financial shall obtain the prior approval of the Commissioner before placing such applications with a qualified broker or lender. Any such placement shall be accompanied by a copy of this Order.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Middlesex Financial shall submit to the Commissioner a detailed record of all of its pending residential mortgage loan applications on property located in Massachusetts. The records to be produced shall be submitted to the Commissioner within five (5) days of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER and shall include all information on file, regarding Middlesex Financial's pending applications, including but not necessarily limited to, the following: 	  The names of all individuals from whom Middlesex Financial has accepted an application for a residential mortgage loan on property located in Massachusetts; the applicants' addresses and telephone numbers; the amount of all prepaid loan fees submitted by the customer; the amount of each loan; application status (i.e. filed, submitted to lenders, cleared to close, etc.); the mortgage lender or financial institution to which the application was placed, and scheduled closing dates. The latter list should include telephone numbers of contact persons familiar with Middlesex Financial's submitted loans.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Middlesex Financial shall immediately secure all pending mortgage loan application files and, to the extent that any original documents must be forwarded to the relevant mortgage broker or lender pursuant to Paragraph 18 of this TEMPORARY ORDER, a copy of such document, correspondence, or paper relating to the mortgage loan shall be retained in Middlesex Financial's books and records and shall be available to the Commissioner, in their entirety, upon request.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this TEMPORARY ORDER shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 30A.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Middlesex Financial shall submit a payment in the amount of $5,000.00 in satisfaction of the statutory penalty at Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 11, for conducting the business of a mortgage broker at its unlicensed location in Lowell, Massachusetts, plus the costs of investigation. Middlesex Financial is hereby ordered to submit a payment in the amount of $5,000.00 in satisfaction of the statutory penalty within five (5) days of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such TEMPORARY ORDER shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from Middlesex Financial within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER. If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this TEMPORARY ORDER shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.     By ORDER AND direction of the Commissioner of Banks.

WHEREAS, subsequent to the issuance of the ORDER, the Division conducted an examination/inspection of Centurion Funding as of August 11, 2005 which illustrated further non-compliance with applicable Massachusetts statutes and the Division of Banks (""Division"") regulations governing the conduct of those engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and a mortgage broker in the Commonwealth.  WHEREAS, Centurion Funding, having been advised of its right to Notice and Hearing pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(a), and having waived those rights, entered into a STIPULATION AND CONSENT TO THE ISSUANCE OF A CONSENT ORDER (""CONSENT AGREEMENT"") with representatives of the Division dated October 23, 2006, whereby, solely for the purpose of settling this matter, and without admitting any allegations or implications of fact or the existence of any violation of state or federal laws and regulations governing the conduct and operation of a mortgage lender and/or a mortgage broker, Centurion Funding agrees to the issuance of this MODIFICATION OF CONSENT ORDER by the Commissioner.  WHEREAS, the Division has considered the matters addressed by the Report of Examination/Inspection (the ""Report"") issued pursuant to the Division's examination/inspection of Centurion Funding as of August 11, 2005 and believes that sufficient cause exists to modify the ORDER issued on March 8, 2004 to more adequately address the condition of the Corporation.

29,12/6/2021,2006,Consent Order,Fintera Capital Corporation,Mortgage Broker,???,Lawrence MA,https://www.mass.gov/consent-order/fintera-capital-corporation," COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  Suffolk, SS.  COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE BROKER LICENSING  Docket No. 2006-021-CO     CONSENT ORDER  In the Matter of  FINTERA CAPITAL CORPORATION  d/b/a HouseFunding  Natick, Massachusetts  Mortgage Broker License Nos. MB3512; MB3803 and MB4399  This CONSENT ORDER, dated December 6, 2006, is by and between the  Division of   Banks , through the Commissioner (the ""Division"")and  Fintera Capital Corporation, d/b/a House Funding (""Fintera"") :  WHEREAS on or about September 8, 2006 the Division issued Findings of Fact and Temporary Order to Cease and Desist against Fintera (the ""Order"").  WHEREAS Fintera disputes the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law in the Order and has requested a hearing pursuant to M.G.L. c. 30A (the ""Dispute"").  WHEREAS, Fintera hereby represents and certifies that on the 6th day of December 2006, the Board of Directors of Fintera, at a duly constituted meeting, adopted resolutions authorizing David Burg, on behalf of Fintera as its duly authorized officer, to enter into this Consent Order in the form submitted to Fintera on this date.  WHEREAS the parties desire a consensual resolution to the Order and Dispute along the terms and conditions set forth below.  The parties stipulate and agree as follows:  On or about July 27, 2004, the Division issued license number MB3512 to Fintera permitting it to engage in the business of a mortgage broker. The Division issued the license for Fintera's office located at 209 West Canal Street in Natick, Massachusetts (the ""Natick Office""). On or about February 11, 2005 the Division issued license number MB3803 to Fintera to engage in the mortgage brokerage business at its office located at 3372 Woods Edge Circle in Bonita Springs, Florida (the ""Bonita Springs Office""). On or about May 18, 2006, the Division issued license number MB4399 to Fintera to engage in the business of a mortgage broker at One Market Street in Lynn, Massachusetts (the ""Lynn Office"").  On August 30, 2006, the Division conducted an on-site inspection in the Lynn Office.  During the on-site inspection, the Division's examiners requested and obtained from Fintera a copy of underwriting guidelines governing stated income loan products of the mortgage lender through whom Fintera placed the stated income loans under review.  The mortgage lender's underwriting guidelines provide a series of factors that are to be taken into account when determining whether the borrower' stated income as reported on the loan application is reasonable. The factors include the age and education of the borrower, work experience, annual income, assets and liabilities, prior income and employment.  To assess an applicant's annual income, the underwriting guidelines permit the broker to use the website, www.salary.com, as a  reference  tool in certain circumstances to validate whether income stated is reasonable. The underwriting guidelines, through  www.salary.com , provide an instrument to  evaluate  the reasonableness of the annual salary reported on the 1003 Form, but are not intended to be used to  establish  the amount that is reported as the applicant's annual income..  Fintera acknowledges that it learned after the Division's inspection that its brokers in the Lynn Office inappropriately used  www.salary.com  in completing loan applications on several occasions.  Fintera believed it had provided sufficient training to its broker in the Lynn Office and that it had sufficient supervisory procedures in place to prevent its brokers from misapplication of tools like  www.salary.com . It now acknowledges that it did not have sufficient supervisory procedures in place to prevent its loan officer from misapplication of such tools with respect to stated income loans.  Fintera shall surrender its three licenses referred to in paragraph 1 hereto immediately upon execution of this Consent Order. 	 General Provisions  This Consent Order shall become effective immediately upon the date of its issuance.  The provisions of this Consent Order shall be binding upon Fintera, its officers, directors, employees, successors and assigns, and those persons in active participation with it, directly or indirectly, acting individually or through any corporate or other entity.  Fintera hereby waives, solely for purposes for settling this proceeding: 	 A hearing under General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(a), for the purpose of taking evidence;  A written decision of the Commissioner;  Exceptions and briefs with respect to such written decision; and  Review of this Consent Order pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 30A.  This Consent Order contains the complete agreement between the parties for the purpose of resolving this matter. There are no other agreements, promises, representations, or warranties between the Division and Fintera.  Dated this 6th day of December, 2006.

WHEREAS, National Lending Corporation, Houston, Texas, a licensed mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2 (""National Lending"") has been advised of its right to Notice and Hearing pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(a), and having waived those rights, entered into a STIPULATION AND CONSENT TO THE ISSUANCE OF A CONSENT ORDER (""CONSENT AGREEMENT"") with representatives of the Division of Banks (""Division"") dated __________________________, 2007, whereby, solely for the purpose of settling this matter, and without admitting any allegations or implications of fact or the existence of any violation of state or federal laws and regulations governing the conduct and operation of a mortgage broker, National Lending agrees to the issuance of this CONSENT ORDER (""ORDER"") by the Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"");  WHEREAS, pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section (7)(b), the Commissioner issued a Findings of Fact and Temporary Order to Cease and Desist, Docket No. 2006-019 (the ""TEMPORARY ORDER""), against National Lending on September 8, 2006, as a result of National Lending's alleged failure to demonstrate and maintain the character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that its mortgage broker business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c); and  WHEREAS, the parties now seek to resolve by mutual agreement, the matters identified in the TEMPORARY ORDER.  ORDER  NOW COME the parties in the above-captioned matter, the Division and National Lending, and stipulate and agree as follows:  National Lending, and its officers, directors, employees, successors and assigns, and those persons in active participation with it, directly or indirectly, acting individually or through any corporate or other entity (collectively referred to as ""National Lending"" or the ""Corporation"") shall be prohibited from engaging in the mortgage broker and mortgage lender business, as those terms are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, for a period of twenty-four (24) months, or as otherwise provided herein, this period to commence upon the effective date of this ORDER.  Notwithstanding the prohibition contained in paragraph 1 hereof, and notwithstanding any of the other provisions hereof, National Lending shall on each successive four month anniversary of the date of the issuance of this ORDER have the right to meet with representatives of the Division to demonstrate to the Division steps taken by National Lending in this jurisdiction and in other jurisdictions that may demonstrate to the Division and/or the Commissioner that a lesser period of time would be appropriate for prohibiting National Lending from engaging in the mortgage broker and mortgage lending business as those terms are defined under Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 255E, Section 1. At each of these meetings, if requested by National Lending, the Division shall consider the information provided to them by National Lending and shall be in their sole and absolute discretion to determine whether it would then be appropriate to consider a shortening of the suspension period and permit National Lending to submit an application to the Division to resume business as either a mortgage broker or mortgage lender.  Within ten (10) days of the effective date of this ORDER, National Lending will surrender each of its Massachusetts mortgage broker licenses, license number(s): MB3245, MB3893, MB3926, MB4118, MB4225, and MB4254, by returning each of the original license certificates to the Division at One South Station, 3rd Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02110.  To the extent that National Lending wishes to resume business as either a mortgage broker or mortgage lender at the expiration of the 24-month term as set forth above, or as otherwise provided for herein National Lending shall be required to obtain the relevant license to do so from the Commissioner. The Commissioner will be assumed to have all of the discretion set forth within General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 in determining whether to issue a license to National Lending to conduct the licensed business provided, however, that any such application submitted more than 24 months after the effective date of this ORDER shall not be denied on the basis of the TEMPORARY ORDER.  Upon execution of the CONSENT AGREEMENT by the Corporation, National Lending will submit to the Division a written withdrawal of the four branch license applications that the Corporation currently has pending with the Division.  National Lending has provided the Division with written certification that the Corporation has successfully notified each of the mortgage lender(s) or financial institution(s) to which the Corporation was placing Massachusetts residential mortgage loans prior to the issuance of the TEMPORARY ORDER that the Corporation has suspended all mortgage broker activity in Massachusetts. This notification provided the mortgage lender or financial institution with accurate contact information of a designated individual both at National Lending and at National Lending's attorney's office that the mortgage lender or financial institution may contact if any mortgage broker activity is attempted to be conducted through the lender or financial institution by an individual or entity purporting to operate on behalf of National Lending.  Upon execution of this ORDER, National Lending shall take all reasonable steps to prevent any former officers, directors, employees, independent contractors, agents, successors and assigns, and those persons in active participation with it, directly or indirectly, from acting under the apparent authority of National Lending to conduct unlicensed mortgage broker activity in Massachusetts. In addition to the lender notification provisions of the preceding paragraph, this subsection of the ORDER shall require National Lending to take appropriate steps to limit or terminate any online application submission authorities which are necessary to effect compliance with this ORDER and shall immediately require National Lending to notify the Division if any mortgage lender or financial institution should contact National Lending regarding any attempted prohibited lending or brokering activity.  The provisions of this ORDER shall not limit, estop, or otherwise prevent the Division, or any state agency or department, from taking any other action affecting National Lending, its officers, directors, employees, successors and assigns, and those persons in active participation with it, directly or indirectly, acting individually or through any corporate or other entity.

MARION d/b/a HOUSE KEY MORTGAGE (""Christina Marion"" or ""House Key Mortgage""), located at 160 Main Street, Suite 5R, Haverhill, Massachusetts (the ""Haverhill Business Office"") has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""TEMPORARY ORDER"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  Christina Marion is, and at all relevant times, has been an individual conducting the business of a mortgage broker in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Christina Marion is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage broker as required by Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner issued Christina Marion's license to engage in the business of a mortgage broker on August 18, 2004 with license number MB3540.  On October 24, 2006, the State of New Hampshire Banking Department (""New Hampshire Department"") issued an Order to Show Cause, Docket No. 06-084, against Christina Marion (""New Hampshire Order to Show Cause""). The New Hampshire Order to Show Cause alleges that Christina Marion failed to file required financial statements and failed to respond to multiple letters that had been sent by the New Hampshire Department.  On January 2, 2007, the New Hampshire Department entered a Default Judgment against Christina Marion for failure to respond to the New Hampshire Order to Show Cause. Pursuant to the Default Judgment, Christina Marion's New Hampshire mortgage broker license was revoked.  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.12(1)(c) states, in part: 	 (1) A Licensee shall notify the Commissioner immediately, and in writing within one business day, of the occurrence of any of the following significant developments: . . . (c) [R]eceiving notification of the institution of license . . . revocation procedures, or other formal or informal regulatory action, in any state against the Licensee, and the reasons thereof.  As of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, the Division has not received notification from Christina Marion of the occurrence of the events referenced above in Sections 3 and 4 of this TEMPORARY ORDER.  On January 29, 2007, pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division requested access to Christina Marion's books and records in order to assess House Key Mortgage's level of compliance with applicable Massachusetts statutes and the Division's regulations governing the conduct of those engaged in the business of a mortgage broker in the Commonwealth.  At all relevant times, information reported by Christina Marion and maintained in the Division's records indicate that all books, records, and accounts relating to the licensed mortgage broker business have been maintained by Christina Marion at the Haverhill Business Office.  On January 29, 2007, the Division requested that House Key Mortgage make such records available for the Division's inspection at the Haverhill Business Office on February 1, 2007 at 9:00 AM.  On February 1, 2007, representatives of the Division arrived at the Haverhill Business Office at or about 9:00 AM and were not granted access to the business office. Without access to the Haverhill Business Office, the Division representatives were unable to conduct an inspection of House Key Mortgage's books, accounts, papers, records and files relating to the Massachusetts licensed mortgage broker business.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8 states, in part: 	 Each licensee shall, when directed by said commissioner, permit said commissioner or his duly authorized representative to inspect its relevant records and evidence of compliance with the provisions of this chapter or any rule or regulation issued hereunder and with any other law, rule or regulation applicable to the conduct of the business for which it is licensed under this chapter . . . . For the purposes of such inspection, said commissioner or his representative shall have access to the offices and place of business, books, accounts, papers, records and files of all such licensees.  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 11, Christina Marion has failed to demonstrate the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 11, Christina Marion failed to notify the Commissioner in writing, within one business day, that the New Hampshire Department, on October 24, 2006, initiated formal regulatory action to revoke her New Hampshire mortgage broker license through the entering an Order to Show Cause, and the reasons thereof, in violation of 209 CMR 42.12(1)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 11, Christina Marion again failed to notify the Commissioner in writing, within one business day, that the New Hampshire Department, through a Default Judgment entered against her on January 2, 2007, had revoked her New Hampshire mortgage broker license, in violation of 209 CMR 42.12(1)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 11, Christina Marion failed to allow the Division's representatives access to House Key Mortgage's office, books, accounts, papers, records and files to permit an inspection, in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8 which authorizes such inspection with or without prior notice to the licensee.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 11, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 Christina Marion has engaged in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that it is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage broker including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. ; and  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to Christina Marion.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 11, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of Christina Marion's original mortgage broker license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in paragraphs 1 through 9 present sufficient grounds for the revocation of Christina Marion's mortgage broker license number MB3540 pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.07(2)(b). 	 ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that Christina Marion and any and all employees, independent contractors, or agents operating on her behalf, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of a mortgage broker, as defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this TEMPORARY ORDER. Therefore, Christina Marion is ordered to immediately cease soliciting or accepting, either directly or indirectly, any residential mortgage loan applications from consumers for residential property located in Massachusetts.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Christina Marion shall immediately place any fees previously collected from Massachusetts consumers relative to any pending mortgage loan applications in a separate escrow account maintained at a federally insured bank.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Christina Marion shall immediately place with one or more qualified broker or lender, as appropriate based on the status of the application and with no loss to applicants, all of her pending Massachusetts residential mortgage loan applications. The open application list to be placed with a qualified broker or lender shall include all transactions in which Christina Marion was performing in the capacity of a mortgage broker. Christina Marion shall obtain the prior approval of the Commissioner before placing such applications to the qualified broker(s) or lender(s).  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Christina Marion shall immediately submit the following information in writing to the Commissioner: 	 A year-to-date balance sheet and statement of income and expense. The balance sheet should indicate House Key Mortgage's cash position at each of its depository banks as well as the corresponding bank account numbers. The balance sheet and statement of income and expense shall be signed and dated by Christina Marion under the pains and penalties of perjury to certify that the information reported is true and accurate and prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A detailed record of pending mortgage loan applications which shall include, but is not limited to, the following: customer name, address, telephone number; all prepaid loan fees submitted by the customer; amount of loan; application status (i.e. filed, submitted to lenders); scheduled closing date; the location of all original open application files; and a list of applicable wholesale lenders. The latter list should include telephone numbers of contact persons familiar with Christina Marion's submitted loans.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Christina Marion shall immediately secure all pending mortgage loan application files and, to the extent that any original documents must be forwarded to the relevant mortgage lender pursuant to Paragraph 20 of this TEMPORARY ORDER, a copy of such document, correspondence, or paper relating to the mortgage loan shall be retained in the Christina Marion's books and records and shall be available to the Commissioner, in their entirety, immediately upon request at the date and time specified by the Commissioner.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this TEMPORARY ORDER shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 30A.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such TEMPORARY ORDER shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from Christina Marion within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER. If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this TEMPORARY ORDER shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE LENDER AND  MORTGAGE BROKER LICENSING  Docket No. 2007-009  FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  LENDERS DIRECT CAPITAL CORPORATION  Lake Forest, California  Mortgage Company License No(s). MC4504 and MC4505  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that LENDERS DIRECT CAPITAL CORPORATION (""Lenders Direct"" or the ""Corporation""), located at 26140 Enterprise Way, Lake Forest, California has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""Temporary Order"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  Lenders Direct is, and at all relevant times, has been a foreign corporation conducting business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Lenders Direct's main office is located at 26140 Enterprise Way, Lake Forest, California.  Lenders Direct is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage lender and mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage company license, license number MC4504, to Lenders Direct to engage in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker on or about October 2, 2006. License number MC4504 authorized Lenders Direct to conduct the mortgage company business from the Corporation's main office located at 26140 Enterprise Way, Lake Forest, California.  Lenders Direct maintains an additional licensed office location at 1370 Washington Pike, Suite 101-C, Bridgeville, Pennsylvania from which the Corporation conducts its mortgage lender and mortgage broker business. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner issued a mortgage company license to Lenders Direct for that location on or about October 2, 2006.  Beginning on or about Monday, February 12, 2007, the Division was alerted by a report published in the  American Banker , a daily financial publication, that Lenders Direct had ceased funding wholesale originations. The Division confirmed this report by reviewing the information which was available on the Lenders Direct website as of February 12, 2007. Specifically, by a notice dated February 9, 2007 and maintained on the Corporation's website, Lenders Direct stated that the Corporation ""is not currently accepting or funding wholesale residential mortgage loans.""  The  American Banker  report further indicated, through statements attributed to the Corporation's President, that Lenders Direct had laid off its entire wholesale lending operations staff and that the Corporation would ""try to manage through the rest of this year"" with its retail lending division.  Based upon the information referenced in Paragraphs 5 and 6, and available to the Division on February 12, 2007, the Division requested that Lenders Direct provide, among other information, a current report of the Corporation's open pipeline of residential mortgage loan applications. In response to the Division's request for information, the Corporation reported via email and letter dated February 12, 2007 that ""[a]s of 5:00 pm Pacific Standard Time on Thursday February 8, 2007 Lenders Direct . . . closed all wholesale operations and ceased originating or funding loans. This situation was brought about by [Lenders Direct] losing its ability to use its warehouse lending facilities as directed by its warehouse lenders.""  A warehouse lending facility is a credit line used by mortgage lenders which enables them to fund mortgage loans prior to selling them to an investor. Without a warehouse lending facility, and in the absence of the mortgage lender independently maintaining sufficient reserves and liquidity positions within the institution to fund such loans, the mortgage lender would be unable to meet its funding commitments, negating its ability to meet contractual obligations to fund mortgage loans.  As of the close of business on Friday, February 9, 2007, after the expiration of the 24-hour period following the cessation of the Corporation's warehouse facilities, Lenders Direct had not notified the Division of the suspension, default, and/or termination of the Corporation's line(s) of credit or warehouse credit agreement(s).  Although the Division is now aware, through the published article appearing in  American Banker , that Lenders Direct has ceased its wholesale operations, the full conditions under which the Corporation's wholesale lending facilities were suspended and/or terminated remain unknown to the Division.  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.12(1)(e) states, in part: 	 (1) A Licensee shall notify the Commissioner immediately, and in writing within one business day, of the occurrence of any of the following significant developments: . . . (e) Expiration, termination or default, technical or otherwise, of any existing line of credit or warehouse credit agreement.  By a letter dated February 14, 2007 which was sent by facsimile at or about 8:00 am (PST) to Michael McQuiggan, President of Lenders Direct, the Division requested that the Corporation provide the following: 	 [A] detailed record of all pending residential mortgage loan applications on properties located in all states ('pipeline report') in which the Licensee holds a mortgage banker or mortgage broker license. The loan pipeline must be updated as of Thursday, February 8, 2007. Further, the Licensee must submit sets of financial statements, including balance sheets and income statements as follow [sic]: one set for the year ended December 31, 2006 as of December 31 and a set for the interim period from January 1, 2007 to February 2, 2007 as of February 2, 2007.  The Division required that Lenders Direct provide the requested materials no later than 1:00 PM (PST) on Wednesday, February 14, 2007.  On February 14, 2007 at approximately 11:15 AM (PST), the Division received via facsimile a letter from Mr. McQuiggan in response to the Division's request for books and records described in Paragraph 12 of this Temporary Order. In his letter, Mr. McQuiggan stated that Lenders Direct could not provide the requested financial statements referenced in paragraph 12 of this Temporary Order within the required period. Mr. McQuiggan further stated that Lenders Direct intends to provide the financial statements with its Annual Report by March 1, 2007. Mr. McQuiggan did not indicate that Lenders Direct would attempt to provide financial statements prior to March 1, 2007. The letter also indicated that Lenders Direct provided a pipeline report of Massachusetts loans on February 12, 2007 and that Lenders Direct does not agree that the Division has authority to request records relating to property located outside the Commonwealth.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8 states, in part: 	 Each licensee shall, when directed by said commissioner, permit said commissioner or his duly authorized representative to inspect its relevant records and evidence of compliance with the provisions of this chapter or any rule or regulation issued hereunder and with any other law, rule or regulation applicable to the conduct of the business for which it is licensed under this chapter . . . . For the purposes of such inspection, said commissioner or his representative shall have access to the offices and place of business, books, accounts, papers, records and files of all such licensees.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.09(4) states, in part, that: 	 (4) In addition to the reports required by law, a Licensee shall make such other statements and reports to the Commissioner as he or she may require from time to time.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.10 states that: 	 By March 1, each Licensee shall file an annual report with the Commissioner in such form as the Commissioner shall prescribe for the preceding calendar year. The annual report shall be in writing, subscribed by the Licensee under the pains and penalty of perjury.  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 16, Lenders Direct failed to notify the Commissioner within one business day of the expiration, termination or default, technical or otherwise, of at least one existing line of credit or warehouse credit agreement, in violation of 209 CMR 42.12(1)(e).  That the requirement contained in the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.10, upon which Lenders Direct relied in submitting its response referenced in Paragraph 13, that each licensee file with the Commissioner of Banks an annual report for the preceding calendar year is a condition of maintaining the mortgage lender and/or mortgage broker license which must be renewed by the Commissioner of Banks on an annual basis.  That the Division's requests for information as set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 16, made pursuant to the Division's inspection authority under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, was not superseded by 209 CMR 42.10.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 16, that the Division's requests for information and the time allotted for a response to such requests were reasonable under the circumstances, given Lenders Direct authority and apparent intention to continue its retail lending and mortgage broker activities under the Corporation's Massachusetts licenses.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 16, Lenders Direct failed to provide the Division with requested books, accounts, statements and reports in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8 and 209 CMR 42.09(4).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 16, Lenders Direct has failed to demonstrate the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.03(2)(c) and 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 16, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 Lenders Direct has engaged in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that it is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. ; and  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to Lenders Direct.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 16, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of Lenders Direct's original mortgage lender license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in paragraphs 1 through 16 present sufficient grounds for the revocation of Lenders Direct's mortgage lender and mortgage broker licenses pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.04(2)(b). 	 ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that Lenders Direct and any and all employees, independent contractors, or agents operating on behalf of Lenders Direct, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Temporary Order. Therefore, Lenders Direct is ordered to immediately cease soliciting or accepting, either directly or indirectly, any residential mortgage loan applications from consumers for residential property located in Massachusetts.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Lenders Direct, shall immediately place any fees previously collected from Massachusetts consumers relative to any pending mortgage loan applications in a separate escrow account maintained at a federally insured bank.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Lenders Direct shall immediately place with one or more qualified broker(s) or lender(s), as appropriate based on the status of the application and with no loss to applicants, all of its pending Massachusetts residential mortgage loan applications. It being understood that ""no loss to the applicant"" shall mean that any loan which may have been closed by Lenders Direct and remains unfunded, as well as any pending application which has been approved by the Corporation but has not yet closed, shall be placed to a lender willing to fund, or close, the mortgage loan under the same terms and conditions extended by Lenders Direct. In the event that no such placement can be made, Lenders Direct shall either independently fund the mortgage loan under such terms and conditions or buy down the mortgage loan offered by the lender so that the applicant does not incur a loss as a result of such placement. Lenders Direct shall obtain the prior approval of the Commissioner before placing such applications to the qualified lender(s) or broker(s) as appropriate.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Lenders Direct shall immediately submit the following information in writing to the Commissioner: 	 A year-to-date balance sheet and statement of income and expense. The balance sheet should indicate Lenders Direct's cash position at each of its depository banks as well as the corresponding bank account numbers. The balance sheet and statement of income and expense shall be signed and dated by an executive officer of Lenders Direct under the pains and penalties of perjury to certify that the information reported is true and accurate and prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A detailed record of all pending residential mortgage loan applications, from both the Corporation's lending and its brokering operations, which shall include, but is not limited to, the following: customer name, address, telephone number; all prepaid loan fees submitted by the customer; amount of loan; application status (i.e. filed, submitted to lenders); scheduled closing date; rate lock status; the location of all original open application files; and a list of applicable wholesale lenders.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE BROKER  LICENSING  Docket No. 2007-010  FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  OLD COMMONWEALTH MORTGAGE, LLC  and NEAL ELBAUM, individually  Garden City, New York  Mortgage Broker License No. MB4074  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that OLD COMMONWEALTH MORTGAGE, LLC and NEAL ELBAUM (collectively, ""Old Commonwealth Mortgage"" or the ""Company""), located at 377 Oak Street, Suite 410, Garden City, New York 11530 has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""TEMPORARY ORDER"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  Old Commonwealth Mortgage is, and at all relevant times, has been a Company doing business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Old Commonwealth Mortgage engages in the business of a mortgage broker at 377 Oak Street, Suite 410, Garden City, New York 11530.  Old Commonwealth Mortgage is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage broker as required by Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner issued Old Commonwealth Mortgage's initial license to engage in the business of a mortgage broker in Massachusetts on or about August 30, 2005.  Neal Elbaum is the president, owner, and sole member of Old Commonwealth Mortgage.  On April 7, 2006, Mr. Elbaum was charged with the following violations of the New York State Penal Law: Commercial Bribing in the First Degree, a Class E Felony; Unlawful Duplication of Computer Related Material, a Class E Felony; Unlawful Possession of Personal Identification Information in the Third Degree, a Class A Misdemeanor (collectively, the ""Charges"").  According to information provided by the District Attorney's Office, Nassau County, New York, the charges against Mr. Elbaum resulted from Mr. Elbaum's alleged theft of proprietary information from Old Merchants Mortgage, Inc., Lake Success, New York (""Old Merchants Mortgage"").  According to information published by the District Attorney's Office, Nassau County, New York and information on file with the Division, Mr. Elbaum was formerly employed by Old Merchants Mortgage before organizing and operating Old Commonwealth Mortgage.  By letter dated April 17, 2006, Old Commonwealth Mortgage, through its attorney, provided written notice to the Division that Mr. Elbaum had been arrested and that the above Charges had been entered against him by the District Attorney's Office, Nassau County, New York.  On December 6, 2006, upon the entering of a guilty plea by Mr. Elbaum to the felony Charge of 'Unlawful Duplication of Computer Related Material', the Nassua County Superior Court sentenced Mr. Elbaum.  By letter dated December 28, 2006, Mr. Elbaum notified the Division that he had pled guilty to the above Charge and, pursuant to the terms of said plea, had been convicted of 'Unlawful Duplication of Computer Materials', in violation of New York Penal Law Section 156.30(1), a Class E Felony. The Division notes that although the letter was dated December 28, 2006, the letter was not received by the Division until February 7, 2007.  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.12(2) states, in part: 	 A Licensee shall notify the Commissioner immediately, and in writing within five business days, of the occurrence of any of the following significant developments: . . . (b) Criminal felony indictment or conviction of any of the Licensee's officers, directors, principal stockholders, or affiliates.  A Short Form Order issued on May 25, 2006, by the Supreme Court, State of New York, County of Nassau, document Index No: 011808/2005 in the matter of Old Merchants Mortgage Inc. d/b/a Old Merchants Mortgage Bankers against Old Commonwealth Mortgage, LLC and Neal Elbaum, individually, indicates that Old Merchants Mortgage was granted summary judgment against Old Commonwealth Mortgage and Neal Elbaum for breach of contract. Specifically, Old Merchants Mortgage presented a prima facie case that Old Commonwealth Mortgage and Mr. Elbaum violated a clause of the employment and compensation agreement by which Old Commonwealth Mortgage and Mr. Elbaum agreed not to interfere with the business of Old Merchants Mortgage for one year post employment and Old Commonwealth Mortgage and Mr. Elbaum did not oppose the motion for summary judgment.  A Short Form Order issued on May 31, 2006, by the Supreme Court, State of New York, County of Nassau, document Index No: 011808/2005 in the matter of Old Merchants Mortgage Inc. d/b/a Old Merchants Mortgage Bankers against Old Commonwealth Mortgage, LLC and Neal Elbaum, individually, indicates that Old Commonwealth Mortgage and Mr. Elbaum, individually, were found in civil contempt for the violation of a July 27, 2005 show cause order restraining Old Commonwealth Mortgage and Mr. Elbaum from accessing and otherwise using proprietary data belonging to Old Merchants Mortgage. 	 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 13, by engaging in activity which resulted in a felony conviction of 'Unlawful Duplication of Computer Materials', Neal Elbaum, individually, has engaged in criminal activity related to the operation of the licensed mortgage broker business.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 13, by engaging in activity which resulted in a felony conviction of 'Unlawful Duplication of Computer Materials', Old Commonwealth Mortgage and Neal Elbaum, individually, have failed to demonstrate the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 13, by notifying the Division on February 7, 2007, by a letter dated December 28, 2006, that Mr. Elbaum entered a guilty plea and was thereby convicted of the above Charge on December 6, 2006, Old Commonwealth Mortgage failed to notify the Commissioner in writing, within five business days, that Neal Elbaum was convicted of a criminal felony, in violation of 209 CMR 42.12(2).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 13, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 Old Commonwealth Mortgage, and Neal Elbaum, individually, have engaged in, or are about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that the licensed business is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage broker including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. ; and  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to Old Commonwealth Mortgage.  A Certificate of Relief from Disabilities issued by the Nassau County Superior Court, State of New York pursuant to Article 23 of the New York State Correction Law does not preclude the Division from relying upon the felony conviction referenced above when exercising its discretionary power to suspend or revoke a mortgage broker license.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 13, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of Old Commonwealth Mortgage's original mortgage broker license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. The facts and conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 13 present sufficient grounds for the revocation of Old Commonwealth Mortgage's mortgage lender license number MB4074 pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.07(2)(b). 	 ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that Neal Elbaum, individually, and Old Commonwealth Mortgage, and any and all employees, independent contractors, or agents operating on behalf of the Company, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of a mortgage broker, as defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this TEMPORARY ORDER. Therefore, Neal Elbaum, individually, and Old Commonwealth Mortgage are ordered to immediately cease soliciting or accepting, either directly or indirectly, any residential mortgage loan applications from consumers for residential property located in Massachusetts.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Old Commonwealth Mortgage shall immediately place any fees previously collected from Massachusetts consumers relative to any pending mortgage loan applications in a separate escrow account maintained at a federally insured bank.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Old Commonwealth Mortgage shall immediately place with one or more qualified broker(s) or lender(s), as appropriate based on the status of the application and with no loss to applicants, all of its pending Massachusetts residential mortgage loan applications. Old Commonwealth Mortgage shall obtain the prior approval of the Commissioner before placing such applications to the qualified lender(s) or broker(s).  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Old Commonwealth Mortgage shall submit to the Commissioner a detailed record, prepared as of the date of submission, of all of the Company's pending residential mortgage loan applications on property located in Massachusetts. The records to be produced shall be submitted to the Commissioner within five (5) days of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER and shall include all information on file, regarding the Company's open application list, including but not necessarily limited to, the following: 	 All information on file as of the date of submission regarding Old Commonwealth Mortgage's open application list as a mortgage broker, including but not limited to, the following: The names of all individuals from whom Old Commonwealth Mortgage has accepted an application for a residential mortgage loan; the applicants' addresses and telephone numbers; the amount of all prepaid loan fees submitted by the customer; the amount of each loan; application status (i.e. filed, submitted to lenders, cleared to close, etc.); scheduled closing dates; rate lock status; and a list identifying the applicable broker or lender with whom the applicants' application was placed. The latter list should include telephone numbers of contact persons familiar with the Company's submitted loans.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Old Commonwealth Mortgage shall immediately secure all pending mortgage loan application files and, to the extent that any original documents must be forwarded to the relevant mortgage broker or lender pursuant to Paragraph 22 of this TEMPORARY ORDER, a copy of such document, correspondence, or paper relating to the mortgage loan shall be retained in the Company's books and records and shall be available to the Commissioner, in their entirety, upon request.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that to the extent that the Company is unable to comply with any provisions contained in Paragraphs 22 through 24 of this TEMPORARY ORDER due to the seizure of records in the execution of a search warrant in the matter which gave rise to the Charges, Old Commonwealth Mortgage shall immediately notify the Division of the Company's inability to comply with such provision and the specific circumstances thereof. Such notice shall provide contact information for the department and/or party that currently possesses the relevant records.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this TEMPORARY ORDER shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 30A.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such TEMPORARY ORDER shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from Old Commonwealth Mortgage within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER. If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this TEMPORARY ORDER shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.

FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  The Parties  New Century Mortgage Corporation  New Century Mortgage is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage lender under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage lender license to New Century Mortgage to engage in the business of a mortgage lender in Massachusetts on or about January 6, 1998.  New Century Mortgage is, and at all relevant times has been, a corporation conducting business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. New Century Mortgage's main office is located at 350 Commerce Street, Suite 100, Irvine, California 92602.  New Century Mortgage maintains additional office locations from which the Corporation conducts the mortgage lender business. According to records maintained on file with the Division, New Century Mortgage currently possesses thirty-one (31) additional mortgage lender licenses from the Commissioner for locations operated both in Massachusetts as well as outside the Commonwealth.  New Century Mortgage is a wholly owned subsidiary of New Century Financial Corporation. New Century Financial Corporation is a publicly traded real estate investment trust listed on the New York Stock Exchange. 	 Home123 Corporation  Home123 is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage lender and mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued mortgage lender and mortgage broker licenses to Home123 to engage in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts on or about September 21, 2000.  Home123 is, and at all relevant times has been, a corporation conducting business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Home123's main office is located at 350 Commerce Street, Suite 100, Irvine, California 92602  Home123 maintains additional office locations from which the corporation conducts the mortgage lender and mortgage broker business. According to records maintained on file with the Division, Home123 currently possesses twenty-five (25) additional mortgage lender and mortgage broker licenses from the Commissioner for locations operated both in Massachusetts as well as outside the Commonwealth.  Home123 Corporation is also a wholly owned subsidiary of New Century Financial Corporation and an affiliate of New Century Mortgage. 	 New Century Credit Corporation  New Century Credit is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage lender under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage lender license to New Century Credit to engage in the business of a mortgage lender in Massachusetts on or about January 19, 2001.  New Century Credit is, and at all relevant times has been, a corporation conducting business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. New Century Credit's main office is located at 3351 Michelson Drive, Suite 400, Irvine, California 92612.  New Century Credit is also a wholly owned subsidiary of New Century Financial Corporation and an affiliate of New Century Mortgage and Home123.  New Century Mortgage, Home123, and New Century Credit are operated, in part, by certain common individuals who perform in the capacity of executive officers, and as members of the Board of Directors, of the three corporations.  Uncertainty of New Century Mortgage's Maintenance of the Minimum Financial Requirements for Holding a Mortgage Lender License in Massachusetts and Failure to Provide Certain Requested Information  On February 7, 2007, the Division became aware, through an article appearing on the financial website  www.Bloomberg.com , of New Century Mortgage's intention to report a loss for the fourth quarter of 2006. The published article also reported that the Corporation would be restating earnings, for the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2006.  On February 9, 2007, the Division became aware, through an article appearing on the financial website  www.yahoo.finance.com , of a decline in New Century Financial Corporation's stock price from $30.16 per share to $19.24 per share between the period of February 7, 2007 and February 8, 2007.  By February 26, 2007, New Century Financial Corporation's stock price had dropped to $15.24 per share at the close of trading.  On or about February 28, 2007, due, in part, to the concerns raised by the publicly reported facts stated in Paragraphs 14 through 16, the Division contacted an executive officer of New Century Mortgage to request information on the current condition of the Corporation. The requested information included, but was not limited to, the following: a ""pipeline report,"" so-called, of then-pending residential mortgage loan applications relating to Massachusetts properties; a summary of the conditions under which New Century Mortgage had been required to repurchase the substantial loan portfolio from its investors which resulted in the Corporation's undertaking of restating earnings for the last three quarters of 2006; the status of the Corporation's warehouse lending agreements; and the balances outstanding on the lines of credit.  New Century Mortgage notified the Division that it would attempt to produce the requested information within the next several business days.  Additional information discussed between the Division and New Century Mortgage on February 28, 2007, included the Division's request from the Corporation for an explanation of when New Century Mortgage reasonably expected, after adjusting quarterly statements from 2006, to have a December 31, 2006 balance sheet and income statement available for review by the Division.  New Century Mortgage indicated financial statements for the period ending December 31, 2006, which continued to be prepared by an independent auditing firm, would likely be available on March 5  th  or on March 15  th  of 2007.  On March 5, 2007, the Division became aware, through information reported on  www.Bloomberg.com , that New Century Financial Corporation's stock had decreased by as much as an additional 63% over the course of the prior seven days to $5.41 per share and had been trading as low as $5.25.  On March 5, 2007, the Division once again contacted New Century Mortgage to request an update on the anticipated availability of the Corporation's financial statements for the period ending December 31, 2006. New Century Mortgage notified the Division that the Corporation would be unable to provide the requested financial statements on March 5, 2007, and further, that the Corporation was no longer able to represent that such statements would be available on the alternate date of March 15, 2007.  At the end of the business day on March 5, 2007, New Century Financial Corporation's stock price had closed at $4.56 per share, which represented a deterioration in the stock price of approximately 69% from the level at which the stock had traded at on February 26, 2007.  As of March 12, 2007, New Century Financial Corporation's stock price was traded at $1.66 per share, which represented a deterioration in the stock price of an additional 64% over the course of the prior seven days and a total of 89% from the level at which the stock had traded at on February 26, 2007.  On March 12, 2007, the New York Stock Exchange suspended trading of New Century Financial Corporation shares.  As of the date of this Temporary Order, New Century Mortgage has responded, in part, to the information referenced in Paragraph 17, but has failed to provide financial statements for the period ending December 31, 2006 or, alternatively, to identify a date on which such financial statements would be available to the Division.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12(1)(k) states in part: 	 A Licensee shall notify the Commissioner immediately, and in writing within one business day, of the occurrence of any of the following significant developments…(k)Any change to net worth resulting from market valuation or future loss liability or any other change which causes the net worth of the licensee to fall below the requirements of 209 CMR 42.03 and 209 CMR 42.11A(1)(a).  As a result of all of the foregoing, the Division is unable to measure the extent to which the recent market devaluations or substantial repurchase obligations have impacted the Corporation or to determine whether New Century Mortgage has maintained the minimum net worth requirement for mortgage lenders as set forth under the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.03 and 209 CMR 42.11A(1)(a).  Due to the Corporation's uncertainty regarding when the requested financial statements will become available, a determination of when the Division would be able to evaluate the financial condition of the Corporation likewise remains uncertain.  Failure to Fund Certain Residential Mortgage Loan Obligations in Massachusetts  On Wednesday, March 7, 2007, the Division received information from two licensed Massachusetts mortgage brokers, (""Mortgage Brokers"") indicating that New Century Mortgage had failed to timely disburse loan proceeds in mortgage loan transactions involving residential property in Massachusetts.  The Mortgage Brokers notified the Division that the refinance loans they had brokered through New Century Mortgage, had closed on Thursday, March 1, 2007 and were scheduled to fund at the conclusion of the rescission period on Tuesday March 6, 2007, however neither loan was funded on that date.  One of the Mortgage Brokers was reportedly advised by a New Century Mortgage representative that the ""earliest his loan would fund would be Monday, March 12, 2007,"" four business days after the original funding date.  The second Mortgage Broker, however, was advised by another New Century Mortgage representative that the ""earliest his loan would fund would be Friday, March 9, 2007, if at all.""  Based upon information available to the Division, as of the effective date of this Temporary Order, one of the loans referenced in Paragraph 30 remains unfunded.  On March 8, 2007, New Century Financial Corporation filed a Form 8K with the Securities and Exchange Commission which disclosed that during the period beginning on March 2, 2007, ""The Company has only been able to fund a portion of its loans this week. In addition its capacity to fund new originations is substantially limited due to its lenders restrictions or refusals to allow the Company to access their financing agreements.""  On March 13, 2007, New Century Mortgage reported to the Division that as of such date, the Corporation had as many as thirty-two residential mortgage loans in Massachusetts that New Century had closed, but to date, had failed to fund.  Impairment of Lender Lines of Credit Used to Fund New Century Mortgage's Lending Operations  On or about March 5, 2007, the Division became aware, through an article appearing on the financial website  www.Bloomberg.com , that due to the Corporation's failure to file timely its 2006 annual report by March 1, 2007, the Corporation had been required to obtain waivers from each of its lenders to maintain access to its lines of credit with those lenders. The article further reported that all eleven of New Century Mortgage's lines of credits remain in jeopardy of being suspended by the respective lenders in the event that New Century Mortgage is unable to file its annual report by March 15, 2007.  Further, because the Corporation will be reporting a net loss for 2006 upon the completion of the restated 2006 reports, New Century Mortgage will be required to obtain a separate waiver from each the lenders providing the lines of credit. As of the end of the business day on March 5, 2007, the Division became aware via the above referenced media articles, that the corporation had received only six of the required eleven waivers on the lines of credit.  Division representatives, in an interview with an executive officer of New Century held on March 5, 2007, confirmed the information reported in Paragraphs 37 and 38.  A line of credit used by a mortgage lender enables the entity to fund mortgage loans prior to selling them to an investor. Without access to its lines of credit, and in the absence of the mortgage lender independently maintaining sufficient reserves and liquidity positions within the institution to fund such loans, the mortgage lender would be unable to meet its funding commitments, negating its ability to meet contractual obligations to fund mortgage loans.  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.12(1)(e) states, in part: 	 A Licensee shall notify the Commissioner immediately, and in writing within one business day, of the occurrence of any of the following significant developments: . . . (e) Expiration, termination or default, technical or otherwise, of any existing line of credit or warehouse credit agreement.  Prior to being contacted by representatives of the Division on March 2, 2007, New Century Mortgage had not notified the Division of the Corporation's failure to file its annual report by March 1, 2007 as required by its lenders, the results thereof, or of any suspension, default, and/or termination of the Corporation's line(s) of credit.  Public comments made by representatives of New Century Financial Corporation have indicated that New Century Financial Corporation has received notices from its lenders of repurchase obligations totaling as much as $8.4 billion, which, if New Century Financial Corporation were unable to obtain relief from such lenders, New Century Financial Corporation would fail to meet these obligations due to its reduced funding capacity.  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.12(1)(g) states, in part, that: 	 A Licensee shall notify the Commissioner immediately, and in writing within one business day, of the occurrence of any of the following significant developments: . . . (g) Exercise of recourse rights by investors or subsequent assignees of mortgage loans if such loans, in the aggregate, exceed the licensee's net worth exclusive of real property and fixed assets.  New Century Financial Corporation further reported in the Form 8K which was filed by on March 8, 2007, that New Century Financial Corporation had received, ""an aggregate of approximately $150 million of margin calls, approximately $80 million of which has been satisfied. The Company has approximately $70 million in outstanding margin calls from five lenders.""  Based upon information and belief, the reduced funding facilities available to the Corporation are preventing New Century Mortgage from honoring its margin calls which remain outstanding. 	 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 46, New Century Mortgage failed to notify the Commissioner within one business day of the expiration, termination or default, technical or otherwise, of at least one existing line of credit or warehouse credit agreement, in violation of 209 CMR 42.12(1)(e).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 46, New Century Mortgage's acts or practices of contracting with consumers for a purchase, or refinance, mortgage loan through the underwriting and subsequent execution of mortgage loan closing documents relating to Massachusetts residential property, and thereafter failing to fund the mortgage loan, may constitute unfair and/or deceptive acts or practices in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 46, by delaying in funding contractual mortgage loan obligations, New Century Mortgage has harmed consumers, mortgage brokers, and other parties in residential mortgage loan transactions in the Commonwealth by engaging in acts or practices which may be unfair and/or deceptive in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 46, New Century Mortgage is unable to demonstrate that the corporation is maintaining the minimum net worth requirements for mortgage lenders in violation of the Division regulation 209 CMR 42.03 and 209 CMR 42.11A(1).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 46, New Century Mortgage has failed to demonstrate the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.03(2)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 46, due to the interlocking relationship of the officers, directors, and principals of New Century Mortgage and Home123 as more fully set forth in Paragraph 13, the Division is unable to conclude that Home123 has demonstrated the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.03(2)(c) and 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 46, due to the interlocking relationship of the officers, directors, and principals of New Century Mortgage and New Century Credit as more fully set forth in Paragraph 13, the Division is unable to conclude that New Century Credit has demonstrated the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.03(2)(c) and 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 46, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 New Century Mortgage, Home123, and New Century Credit have engaged in, are engaging in, or are about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that they are not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. ; and  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to New Century Mortgage, Home123, New Century Credit.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 46, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of New Century Mortgage's, Home123's, or New Century Credit's original mortgage lender and mortgage broker license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license(s) to the respective entity. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in paragraphs 1 through 46 present sufficient grounds for the revocation of New Century Mortgage's, Home123's, and New Century Credit's lender and/or broker licenses pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.04(2)(b). 	 ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that New Century Mortgage, Home123, New Century Credit, and any and all officers, directors, employees, independent contractors, or agents operating on behalf of such corporation, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker, as defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Temporary Order.

It being understood that ""no loss to the applicant"" shall mean that any loan which may have been closed by New Century Mortgage, Home123, or New Century Credit and remains unfunded, as well as any pending application which has been approved by the corporation but has not yet closed, shall be placed to a lender willing to fund, or close, the mortgage loan under the same terms and conditions extended by New Century Mortgage,Home123, or New Century Credit. In the event that no such placement can be made, New Century Mortgage, Home123, or New Century Credit shall either independently fund the mortgage loan under such terms and conditions or buy down the mortgage loan offered by the lender so that the applicant does not incur a loss as a result of such placement. New Century Mortgage, Home123, and New Century Credit shall obtain the prior approval of the Commissioner before placing such applications to the qualified lender(s) or broker(s) as appropriate.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that by 5:00 p.m. eastern standard time on each business day following the effective date of this Temporary Order, the Corporation shall submit to the Division a liquidity report on each of its eleven warehouse lines of credit, and provide such information as will be necessary by the Division to determine that the corporation will be able to fund current loans in its pipeline, while also maintaining the minimum net worth requirements for licensed mortgage lenders in accordance with the Division's regulations.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that in any instance in which New Century Mortgage, Home123, or New Century Credit failed to fund a loan closed by the corporation and in which the consumer obtained funding through an alternate lender prior to the effective date of this Temporary Order, the defaulting corporation shall reimburse each consumer the amount necessary to put the consumer in the same position as if the corporation had funded the mortgage loan under the terms and conditions agreed upon at the closing of the loan.

The form of the status report shall follow the format of the initial submission under subparagraphs 61(a) and 61(b) and shall indicate the final disposition of the loan application and include the final terms under which each approved loan is closed. The reporting requirement shall continue until each of the approved applications is funded by New Century Mortgage, Home123, or New Century Credit or withdrawn by the applicant(s); and  As soon as possible, but not later than two (2) days after the effective date of this Temporary Order, New Century Mortgage, Home123, and New Century Credit shall submit to the Commissioner a balance sheet and year-to-date income statement, prepared as of the date of submission, and attested to by a duly authorized officer of the corporation. The balance sheet should indicate bank account numbers as well as the corporation's cash position at each of its depository banks.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that New Century Mortgage, Home123, and New Century Credit shall immediately secure all pending mortgage loan application files and, to the extent that any original documents must be forwarded to the relevant mortgage lender or mortgage broker pursuant to Paragraph 58 of this Temporary Order, a copy of such document, correspondence, or paper relating to the mortgage loan shall be retained in the corporation's books and records, and shall be available to the Commissioner, in their entirety, immediately upon request on the date and time specified by the Commissioner.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that New Century Mortgage, Home123, and New Century Credit shall not pay or declare any dividend or bonus, nor otherwise authorize any other material distribution of the corporation's assets to any officer, director, or owner of the corporation without the prior written approval of the Commissioner. Upon the effective date of this Temporary Order, New Century Mortgage, Home123, and New Century Credit shall implement or revise its practices and procedures, as necessary, to ensure that the corporation's financial books and records are accurately maintained, in a manner illustrating compliance with the provisions of this Paragraph, and available for review by the Division's examiners upon request.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Temporary Order shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 30A.

If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this Temporary Order shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE BROKER  LICENSING  Docket No. 2007-014  FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  APEX FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.,  d/b/a AAPEX MORTGAGE  Brandon, Florida  Mortgage Company License No(s). MC1248 and MC4665  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that APEX FINANCIAL GROUP, INC., d/b/a AAPEX MORTGAGE (""Aapex Mortgage"" or the ""Corporation""), located at 213 Bloomingdale Avenue, Brandon, Florida has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""TEMPORARY ORDER"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  Aapex Mortgage is, and at all relevant times, has been a foreign corporation conducting business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Aapex Mortgage's main office is located at 213 Bloomingdale Avenue, Brandon, Florida.  Aapex Mortgage is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage lender and mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage lender license, license number ML1248, to Aapex Mortgage to engage in the business of a mortgage lender on or about September 30, 1999. The Commissioner initially issued a mortgage broker license, license number MB2216, to Aapex Mortgage to engage in the business of a mortgage broker on or about March 28, 2001. On or about June 1, 2003, the mortgage lender and mortgage broker licenses were combined under a mortgage company license, license number MC1248. License number MC1248 authorized Aapex Mortgage to conduct the mortgage company business from the Corporation's main office located at 213 Bloomingdale Avenue, Brandon, Florida.  Aapex Mortgage maintains an additional licensed office location at 17 Poplar Street, Roslindale, Massachusetts, from which the Corporation conducts its mortgage lender and mortgage broker business. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner issued a mortgage company license, license number MC4665, to Aapex Mortgage for that location on or about January 12, 2007.  Failure to Provide Notification of Regulatory Actions Entered in Other States  North Carolina Consent Agreement  On January 24, 2007, the Office of the Commissioner of Banks of the State of North Carolina (""North Carolina Banking Department"") and Aapex Mortgage entered into a Consent Agreement, Docket No 06:078:MBB (""Consent Agreement"") to resolve matters initially raised by a North Carolina Banking Department examination of Aapex Mortgage.  In the Consent Agreement, the North Carolina Banking Department recites that, if the matter were to proceed to hearing, the North Carolina Office of the Commissioner of Banks would put on evidence which it contends would show that a routine examination conducted by the North Carolina Banking Department in October 2005, revealed that 32 of 185 loans reviewed as part of the examination were closed through Aapex Mortgage by unlicensed individuals.  In the Consent Agreement, the North Carolina Banking Department further alleges that the October examination revealed that Aapex Mortgage had violated additional North Carolina statutes and rules, including laws relevant to net branching, charging of fees to consumers, record keeping, and the use of trust accounts in North Carolina.  Pursuant to the terms of the Consent Agreement, Aapex Mortgage did not admit or deny the allegations relating to unlicensed activity. 	 Alabama Revocation Order  On January 25, 2007, The State of Alabama State Banking Department (""Alabama Banking Department"") issued an Order revoking the license of Aapex Mortgage and requiring that Aapex Mortgage cease and desist from further operations in the state of Alabama, Case #CC-2006-10. (""Alabama Order"").  In the Alabama Order, the Alabama Banking Department concluded that Aapex Mortgage was conducting business from several unlicensed locations in Alabama.  The Alabama Order further states that several complaints had been filed with the Alabama Banking Department regarding the operations of Aapex Mortgage and one particular employee, Christopher Collins.  The complaints specifically referenced in the Alabama Order were taken in April and September 2006. According to the Alabama Order, Mr. Collins had been collecting ""cash deposits"" from applicants and then failing to obtain a loan for them. The Alabama Order notes that in its response to the April 2006 complaint to the Alabama Banking Department, the Corporation identified Mr. Collins as a ""potential employee."" In the interim, Mr. Collins was hired by Aapex Mortgage. Mr. Collins was terminated in October 2006, after another compliant had been forwarded by the Alabama Banking Department to Aapex Mortgage. The Alabama Order notes that Mr. Collins' conduct in April ""would seem valid grounds NOT to hire a ""potential employee"".  The Alabama Order states, "" [I]n consideration of the track record of [Aapex Mortgage] as a whole, it appears that there are sufficient grounds for revocation of Aapex's license . `. . . [Aapex Mortgage] has not conducted its business in accordance with the laws of this state."" 	 Ohio Notice of Intent  On February 27, 2007, The State of Ohio Department of Commerce, Division of Financial Institutions (""Ohio Department of Commerce"") issued a Notice of Intent to Revoke Aapex Mortgage's mortgage broker certificate of registration, Case No. M2007-80. (""Ohio Notice"").  The Ohio Notice stated that on February 6, 2007, Aapex Mortgage was notified by the Ohio Secretary of State (""Secretary of State"") that the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation/Certificate of Authority had been cancelled due to the Corporation's nonpayment of its franchise tax within the time required by law.  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.12(1)(c) states, in part: 	 A Licensee shall notify the Commissioner immediately, and in writing within one business day, of the occurrence of any of the following significant developments: . . . (c) Receiving notification of the institution of license . . . revocation procedures, or other formal or informal regulatory action, in any state against the Licensee, and the reasons thereof.  As of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, the Division has not received notification from Aapex Mortgage of the occurrence of the events referenced above in Paragraphs 5 through 16 of this TEMPORARY ORDER.  Failure to File Quarterly Reports and Financial Statements in Accordance with Division Reporting Standards  The Division requires licensed mortgage lenders to submit quarterly reports to the Division within forty-five days of the end of the calendar quarter.  The Division's Regulation 209 CMR 42.09(4) states in part: 	 In addition to the reports required by law, a Licensee shall make such other statements and reports to the Commissioner as he or she may require from time to time. The Commissioner may require regular quarterly reports and may furnish blank forms for all such statements or reports, required by 209 CMR 42.09.  As of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, Aapex Mortgage has failed to submit quarterly reports and corresponding financial statements for the quarters ending June 30, 2006 and September 30, 2006. In addition, for the quarter ending March 31, 2006, the Corporation submitted only the quarterly report, and failed to submit the corresponding financial statement.  Failure to Provide Information Requested Pursuant to a Division Inspection of the Corporation  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8 states, in part, that: 	 Each licensee shall, when directed by said commissioner, permit said commissioner or his duly authorized representative to inspect its relevant records and evidence of compliance with the provisions of this chapter or any rule or regulation issued hereunder and with any other law, rule or regulation applicable to the conduct of the business for which it is licensed under this chapter . . . . For the purposes of such inspection, said commissioner or his representative shall have access to the offices and place of business, books, accounts, papers, records and files of all such licensees.  On November 16, 2006, pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division requested access to Aapex Mortgage's books and records in order to assess Aapex Mortgage's level of compliance with applicable Massachusetts statutes and the Division's regulations governing the conduct of those engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in the Commonwealth.  At all relevant times, information reported by Aapex Mortgage and maintained in the Division's records indicate that all books, records, and accounts relating to the licensed mortgage company business have been maintained by Aapex Mortgage at the Corporation's main office in Brandon, Florida.  On November 28, 2006, the Division once again requested the documents referenced in Paragraph 22. Mr. Paul Czap, the individual designated by the Corporation as the contact person for Division requests, stated that the Corporation was ""working"" on the request.  On December 8, 2006, during a series of e-mail communications with the Division, Mr. Czap stated that although the company was having some ""hardware problems"" they would be e-mailing the requested information the next day, December 9, 2006, at the latest.  The Division's regulation governing the maintenance of books and records, at 209 CMR 48.04 states, in part: 	 ""Each Licensee shall keep and use its books, records, and accounts within the Commonwealth, except, however, that with the prior approval by the Commissioner of a written plan, a Licensee may keep such books, records, and accounts at a location, or locations, outside of the Commonwealth. Such written plan shall contain:  (1) an agreement to provide access, within 72 hours of an official request, to any requested books, records, and accounts to a suitable and mutually agreed upon location within the Commonwealth for the purpose of examination…""  On December 11, 2006, after failing to receive the information referenced in Paragraph 25, the Division e-mailed the Corporation a letter referencing the above regulation and renewed the Division's request for the information.  On December 22, 2006, the Division notified Aapex Mortgage that although most files had been received, some additional information was necessary in order for the examination to commence.  On December, 29, 2006, January 8, 2007, and January 17, 2007, the Division contacted Aapex Mortgage to follow up on the December 22, 2006 notification, regarding the additional information. In all correspondence, the Division referenced the Division's regulation cited in Paragraph 26 of this Temporary Order.  On January 26, 2007, pursuant to her request on such date, Beverly Alexander, another representative of the Corporation, was provided with a duplicate list of the documents that were necessary to be submitted in order to permit the initiation of the Division's examination.  On January 30, 2007, the Division received some of the requested documents, including a revised list of Massachusetts residential loans made during the review period.  On January 30, 2007, January 31, 2007, February 1, 2007, and February 2, 2007 the Division had several telephone conversations with Beverly Alexander regarding the remaining documents that had been requested by the Division.  On February 7, 2007, after several telephone conversations with Beverly Alexander, Roy Williams, President of Aapex Mortgage, notified the Division that Aapex Mortgage was unable to provide the Division with the requested information regarding the number of loans the Corporation had closed as a mortgage broker and as a mortgage lender.  On February 8, 2007, the Division received a revised loan list, after contacting the Corporation about some discrepancies in the information reported. The new list provided by the Corporation referenced 648 Massachusetts residential loan transactions whereas the list provided to the Division by Aapex Mortgage in December 2006 identified only 13 transactions.  On February 23, 2007, the Division requested more information regarding the discrepancy in the number of transactions reported during previous communications with the Corporation in December 2006, and further referenced the documents that had previously been requested on November 16, 2006, December 22, 2006, and January 26, 2007.  As of the effective date of this Temporary Order, certain information which was requested in an accordance with an examination which was initiated on or about November 16, 2006 has not been provided to the Division by Aapex Mortgage. 	 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 36, Aapex Mortgage has failed to demonstrate the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 36, Aapex Mortgage failed to notify the Commissioner in writing, within one business day, that on January 24, 2007, the North Carolina Banking Department and Aapex Mortgage entered into a Consent Agreement, in violation of 209 CMR 42.12(1)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 36, Aapex Mortgage failed to notify the Commissioner in writing, within one business day, that on January 25, 2007 the AlabamaBanking Department issued an Order revoking the Corporation's license and requiring that that the Corporation cease and desist from further activity in the state of Alabama, in violation of 209 CMR 42.12(1)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 36, Aapex Mortgage failed to notify the Commissioner, in writing, within one business day, that on February 27, 2007, the Ohio Department of Commerce issued to the Corporation a Notice of Intent to Revoke Mortgage Broker Registration, in violation of 209 CMR 42.12(1)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 36, Aapex Mortgage repeatedly failed to provide the Division's representatives with access to Aapex Mortgage's books, accounts, records and files to permit an inspection in violation of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 48.04(1), which authorizes such an inspection within 72 hours of an official request.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 36, Aapex Mortgage failed to allow the Division's representatives access to Aapex Mortgage's office, books, accounts, papers, records and files to permit an inspection, in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8 which authorizes such inspection with or without prior notice to the licensee.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 36, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 Aapex Mortgage has engaged in, is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that it is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. ; and  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to Aapex Mortgage.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 36, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of Aapex Mortgage's original mortgage lender license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in paragraphs 1 through 36 present sufficient grounds for the revocation of Aapex Mortgage's mortgage lender and mortgage broker licenses pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.04(2)(b) and 209 CMR 42.07(2) (b). 	 ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that Aapex Mortgage and any and all officers, directors, employees, independent contractors, or agents operating on behalf of Aapex Mortgage, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Temporary Order. Therefore, Aapex Mortgage is ordered to immediately cease soliciting or accepting, either directly or indirectly, any residential mortgage loan applications from consumers for residential property located in Massachusetts.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Aapex Mortgage, shall immediately place any fees previously collected from Massachusetts consumers relative to any pending mortgage loan applications in a separate escrow account maintained at a federally insured bank.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Aapex Mortgage shall immediately place with one or more qualified broker(s) or lender(s), as appropriate based on the status of the application and with no loss to applicants, all of its pending Massachusetts residential mortgage loan applications. It being understood that ""no loss to the applicant"" shall mean that any loan which may have been closed by Aapex Mortgage and remains unfunded, as well as any pending application which has been approved by the Corporation but has not yet closed, shall be placed to a lender willing to fund, or close, the mortgage loan under the same terms and conditions extended by Aapex Mortgage. In the event that no such placement can be made, Aapex Mortgage shall either independently fund the mortgage loan under such terms and conditions or buy down the mortgage loan offered by the lender so that the applicant does not incur a loss as a result of such placement. Aapex Mortgage shall obtain the prior approval of the Commissioner before placing such applications to the qualified lender(s) or broker(s) as appropriate.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that as soon as possible, but in no event later than two days after the effective date of this Temporary Order, Aapex Mortgage shall submit the following information in writing to the Commissioner: 	 A year-to-date balance sheet and statement of income and expense. The balance sheet should indicate Aapex Mortgage's cash position at each of its depository banks as well as the corresponding bank account numbers. The balance sheet and statement of income and expense shall be signed and dated by an executive officer of Aapex Mortgage under the pains and penalties of perjury to certify that the information reported is true and accurate and prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A detailed record of all pending residential mortgage loan applications, from both the Corporation's lending and its brokering operations, which shall include, but is not limited to, the following: customer name, address, telephone number; all prepaid loan fees submitted by the customer; amount of loan; application status (i.e. filed, submitted to lenders); scheduled closing date; rate lock status; the location of all original open application files; and a list of applicable wholesale lenders. The latter list should include telephone numbers of contact persons familiar with Aapex Mortgage's submitted loans.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Aapex Mortgage shall immediately secure all pending mortgage loan application files and, to the extent that any original documents must be forwarded to the relevant mortgage lender or mortgage broker pursuant to Paragraph 47 of this Temporary Order, a copy of such document, correspondence, or paper relating to the mortgage loan shall be retained in Aapex Mortgage's books and records and shall be available to the Commissioner, in their entirety, immediately upon request on the date and time specified by the Commissioner.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Temporary Order shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 30A.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such Temporary Order shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from Aapex Mortgage within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this Temporary Order. If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this Temporary Order shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE LENDER  LICENSING  Docket No. 2007-016  FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  SOUTHSTAR FUNDING, LLC  Atlanta, Georgia  Mortgage Lender License No. ML2251  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that SOUTHSTAR FUNDING, LLC., (""SouthStar Funding"" or the ""Company""), located at 400 Northridge Road, Suite 1000, Atlanta, Georgia 30350 has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""TEMPORARY ORDER"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage lender in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  SouthStar Funding is, and at all relevant times, has been a foreign Corporation conducting business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. SouthStar Funding's main office is located at 400 Northridge Road, Suite 1000, Atlanta, Georgia 30350.  SouthStar Funding is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage lender under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage lender license to SouthStar Funding to engage in the business of a mortgage lender on or about October 9, 2002.  On Monday, April 2, 2007, a licensed Massachusetts mortgage broker (""Mortgage Broker A"") notified the Division that SouthStar Funding had failed, or was about to fail, to timely disburse loan proceeds in two mortgage loan transactions involving a single residential property in Massachusetts which Mortgage Broker A had placed with SouthStar Funding.  According to Mortgage Broker A, two loans (Loan# 3000027543 for $318,400.00; and Loan# 3000027845 for $39,800.00) that his firm had brokered to SouthStar Funding, had closed on Tuesday, March 27, 2007, and were scheduled to fund on Monday, April 2, 2007, at the conclusion of the loan rescission period. At the time that Mortgage Broker A contacted the Division on April 2, 2007, neither loan had been funded.  Mortgage Broker A notified the Division that his office had received a call from a representative of SouthStar Funding on Saturday, March 31, 2007, notifying the mortgage broker that the Company would be ceasing all operations by the end of April 2007. However, the SouthStar Funding representative assured Mortgage Broker A that SouthStar Funding would continue to process any loan applications that the Company had previously accepted and remained pending.  On Sunday, April 1, 2007, the Mortgage Broker received a second call from a representative of SouthStar Funding indicating that the Company would be ceasing all operations immediately.  On Monday, April 2, 2007, at approximately 10:18 a.m., the closing attorney for the loans referenced in Paragraph 5, forwarded to the Division, by facsimile, a copy of the notification that his law firm had received at approximately 9:51 a.m. from SouthStar Funding, which stated, in part, that ""SouthStar Funding, had ceased its mortgage lending operations effective immediately and was unable to close or fund any loans.""  The facsimile notification forwarded stated in part, ""DO NOT …fund any loans from this point forward,"" and further instructed the closing attorney to return all SouthStar funds held in the firm's client trust account (IOLTA), previously transmitted for the purpose of funding residential mortgage loans, by wire transfer immediately.  On Monday, April 2, 2007, the Division reviewed the Web site maintained by SouthStar Funding which confirmed the representations made to the Division by the industry participants referenced above whereby SouthStar Funding had posted the following message to its Web site: 	 SouthStar Funding, LLC sincerely regrets that it was necessary to cease its mortgage lending operations. The recent unprecedented downturn and policy changes in the mortgage industry necessitated this action.  On Monday, April 2, 2007, at approximately 11:47 a.m., the Division received information from a second licensed Massachusetts mortgage broker, (""Mortgage Broker B"") indicating that SouthStar Funding had recently sent him a notification via e-mail stating in part that SouthStar Funding was ""ceasing its mortgage lending operations on April 2, 2007,"" and that the Company would not be closing or funding any residential loans going forward.  SouthStar Funding's notification to Mortgage Broker B further stated that the events leading to the Company's decision to cease funding loans began the week of March 26, 2007, when two of the Company's primary purchasers of loans refused to fund loan pools that were already locked and committed until such time as SouthStar Funding reimbursed them for all of the Company's existing repurchase obligations, something that SouthStar noted that it was ""financially [sic] unable to do.""  The notification to Mortgage Broker B further stated that, with respect to another loan sale agreement, a separate investor had apparently ""bought only a portion of loans that they had previously committed to"" without disclosing the conditions under which the diminished sale occurred.  The e-mail correspondence from SouthStar Funding referenced in Paragraph 12 stated that as a result of the events set forth therein, the Company was ""approaching an insolvency situation.""  Based upon information and belief, the loans referenced in Paragraph 5, have not yet funded as of the date of this TEMPORARY ORDER.  Notwithstanding the correspondence between SouthStar Funding and the mortgage lending industry participants referenced above, SouthStar Funding had not notified the Division of the facts and circumstances set forth above as of the issuance of this TEMPORARY ORDER. 	 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 16, SouthStar Funding's acts or practices of contracting with consumers, through the underwriting and subsequent execution of mortgage loan closing documents relating to Massachusetts residential property, and thereafter failing to fund the mortgage loans may constitute unfair and/or deceptive acts or practices in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 16, due to the delay in funding contractual mortgage loan obligations SouthStar Funding has harmed a consumer, mortgage brokers, and other parties in residential mortgage loan transactions in the Commonwealth by engaging in acts or practices which may be unfair and/or deceptive in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 16, by contracting to originate mortgage loans that the Company did not have sufficient warehouse funds available to fund, or any other available, alternative source of funds SouthStar Funding has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices in violation of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.04(2)(b)(3).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 16, SouthStar Funding failed to notify the Commissioner within one business day of the expiration, termination or default, technical or otherwise, of at least one existing line of credit or warehouse credit agreement, in violation of 209 CMR 42.12(1)(e).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 16, SouthStar Funding, which has indicated that the Company is approaching insolvency, failed to notify the Commissioner within one business day of the exercise of recourse rights by investors or subsequent assignees of mortgage loans if such loans, in the aggregate, exceed the licensee's net worth exclusive of real property and fixed assets in violation of 209 CMR 42.12(1)(g).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 16, SouthStar Funding failed to provide the Commissioner with thirty days prior written notice of the Company's intention to cease business operations in violation of 209 CMR 42.13(2).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 16, SouthStar Funding has failed to demonstrate the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.03(2)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 16, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 SouthStar Funding has engaged in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that it is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage lender including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. ; and  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to SouthStar Funding.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 16, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of SouthStar Funding's original mortgage lender license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in paragraphs 1 through 16 present sufficient grounds for the revocation of SouthStar Funding mortgage lender license pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.04(2)(b). 	 ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that SouthStar Funding and any and all officers, directors, employees, independent contractors, or agents operating on behalf of SouthStar Funding, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of a mortgage lender, as defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this TEMPORARY ORDER. Therefore, SouthStar Funding is ordered to immediately cease soliciting or accepting, either directly or indirectly, any residential mortgage loan applications from consumers for residential property located in Massachusetts.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that SouthStar Funding, shall immediately place any fees previously collected from Massachusetts consumers relative to any pending mortgage loan applications in a separate escrow account maintained at a federally insured bank.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that SouthStar Funding shall not pay or declare a dividend, nor otherwise authorize or execute any financial transaction, either singular or structured, in excess of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.00), except for wages and salaries paid to employees, contractors, officers, or other members of the Company's management in the normal course of SouthStar Funding's business, without the prior written approval of the Commissioner. Upon the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, SouthStar Funding shall implement or revise its practices and procedures, as necessary, to ensure that the Company's financial books and records are accurately maintained, in a manner illustrating compliance with the provisions of this Paragraph, and available for review by the Division's examiners upon request.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that SouthStar Funding shall immediately place with one or more qualified lender(s), with no loss to applicants, the following: (a) the Company's entire portfolio of Massachusetts residential mortgage loans which were closed by the Company, and remain unfunded as of the issuance of this Temporary Order; and (b) the Company's entire pending application list of Massachusetts residential mortgage loans. It being understood that ""no loss to the applicant"" shall mean that any loan which was closed by SouthStar Funding, as well as any application which was approved by the Company, shall be placed to a lender willing to fund, or close, the mortgage loan under the same terms and conditions extended by SouthStar Funding. In the event that no such placement can be made, SouthStar Funding shall either independently fund the mortgage loan under such terms and conditions or buy down the mortgage loan offered by the lender so that the applicant does not incur a loss as a result of such placement. SouthStar Funding shall obtain the prior approval of the Commissioner before placing such applications to the qualified lender(s).  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that in any instance in which SouthStar Funding failed to fund a loan closed by the Company and in which the consumer, prior to the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, obtained funding through an alternate lender, the Company shall reimburse each consumer the amount necessary to put the consumer in the same position as if SouthStar Funding had funded the mortgage loan under the terms and conditions agreed upon at the closing of the loan.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that SouthStar Funding shall submit to the Commissioner a detailed record, prepared as of the date of submission, of all of the Company's pending residential mortgage loan applications on property located in Massachusetts. The records to be produced shall include all information on file regarding the Company's Massachusetts mortgage loan portfolio, including but not necessarily limited to, the following: 	 Within one (1) day of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, SouthStar Funding shall submit to the Commissioner all information on file as of the date of submission regarding the Company's portfolio of mortgage loans that were closed by SouthStar Funding prior to the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, but remain as yet unfunded. Such information shall include, but is not limited to, the following: The names of all individuals from whom SouthStar Funding processed an application and closed the residential mortgage loan, but failed to fund; the applicants' addresses and telephone numbers; the loan number; the amount of all prepaid loan fees submitted by the customer; the amount of each loan; the loan terms; the current funding status; the actual closing dates; the loan purpose (i.e. purchase or refinance); and identification of the applicable lender with whom each application will be placed. The record should include telephone numbers of contact persons at each lender who is familiar with the Company's submitted loans;  As soon as possible, but not later than five (5) days after the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, SouthStar Funding shall submit to the Commissioner (i) all information on file as of the date of submission regarding the Company's pipeline of pending mortgage loan applications including but not limited to, the following: The names of all individuals from whom SouthStar Funding has accepted an application for a residential mortgage loan; the applicants' addresses and telephone numbers; the loan number; the amount of all prepaid loan fees submitted by the customer; rate lock status; the amount of each loan; application status (i.e. filed, submitted to lenders, cleared to close, etc.); loan terms, if approved; scheduled closing dates; the loan purpose (i.e. purchase or refinance); and identification of the applicable lender with whom each application will be placed. The record should include telephone numbers of contact persons at each lender who is familiar with the Company's submitted loans; and (ii) SouthStar Funding's balance sheet and year-to-date income statement, prepared as of the date of submission, and attested by a duly authorized officer of the Company. The balance sheet should indicate SouthStar Funding's cash position at each of its depository banks as well as SouthStar Funding's bank account numbers; and  On the last business day of each subsequent week after the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, SouthStar Funding shall provide the Commissioner with an updated, written status report of the mortgage loan applications identified above under subparagraphs 31(a) and 31(b). The form of the status report shall follow the format of the initial submission under subparagraphs 31(a) and 31(b) and shall indicate the final disposition of the loan application and include the final terms under which each approved loan is closed. The reporting requirement shall continue until each of the approved applications is placed with a lender and funded, funded by SouthStar Funding, or withdrawn by the applicant(s).  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that SouthStar Funding shall immediately secure all pending mortgage loan application files and, to the extent that any original documents must be forwarded to the relevant mortgage lender pursuant to Paragraph 29 of this TEMPORARY ORDER, a copy of such document, correspondence, or paper relating to the mortgage loan shall be retained in the Company's books and records and shall be available to the Commissioner, in their entirety, upon request.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this TEMPORARY ORDER shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 30A.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such TEMPORARY ORDER shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from SouthStar Funding within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER. If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this TEMPORARY ORDER shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE LENDER AND  MORTGAGE BROKER LICENSING  Docket No. 2007-017  FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  DANA CAPITAL GROUP, INC  Irvine, California  Mortgage Company License No(s). MC1525, et al.  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that Dana Capital Group, Inc., (""Dana Capital"" or the ""Corporation""), located at 8001 Irvine Center Drive, Suite 1200, Irvine, California, 92618 has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""TEMPORARY ORDER"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  Dana Capital is, and at all relevant times, has been a foreign Corporation conducting business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Dana Capital's main office is located at 8001 Irvine Center Drive, Suite 1200, Irvine, California.  Dana Capital is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage lender and mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage company license, license number MC1525, to Dana Capital to engage in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker on or about August 17, 2004. License number MC1525 authorized Dana Capital to conduct the mortgage company business from the Corporation's main office located at 8001 Irvine Center Drive, Suite 1200, Irvine, California.  According to information on record with the Division, Dana H. Smith is an officer, Chairman of the Board of Directors, and sole owner of Dana Capital.  Dana Capital maintains two additional office locations from which the Corporation conducts its mortgage lender and mortgage broker business relative to Massachusetts residential property.  Dana Capital maintains a licensed office location at 17011 Beach Boulevard, Suite 111, Huntington Beach, California 92647 from which the Corporation conducts its mortgage lender and mortgage broker business. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner issued a mortgage company license to Dana Capital for that location on or about August 29, 2006.  Dana Capital maintains a licensed office location at 4693 MacArthur Court, 11  th  Floor, Newport Beach, California 92660 from which the Corporation conducts its mortgage lender and mortgage broker business. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner issued a mortgage company license to Dana Capital for that location on October 26, 2006.  	  	 Failure to Demonstrate the Financial Responsibility, Character, Reputation, Integrity, and General Fitness to Maintain a Mortgage Company License  On Tuesday, March 27, 2007, pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division commenced an examination of Dana Capital's books and records in order to assess the Corporation's level of compliance with applicable Massachusetts statutes and the Division's regulations governing the conduct of those engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in the Commonwealth.  On Monday, April 23, 2007, upon completion of the examination, the Division's examiner conducted an exit interview via teleconference with, Amanda L. Smith, the compliance director and designated representative of Dana Capital.  At no time during the exit interview did Dana Capital notify the Division of the Corporation's intention of winding down the Corporation, an event which reportedly took place approximately seven (7) days subsequent to the exit interview.  On or about Monday, May 6, 2007, the Division became aware, through published reports, that Dana Capital was winding down its operations and had ceased conducting business through its main office as of April 30, 2007.  On Tuesday, May 7, 2007, the Division attempted to place several calls to Dana Capital's main office located at 8001 Irvine Center Drive, Suite 1200, Irvine, California to determine the accuracy of the information reported regarding Dana Capital's dissolution, however representatives of Dana Capital were unavailable throughout the day.  On Tuesday, May 7, 2007, the Division was able to contact Mark J. Quinn, the individual designated by Dana Capital as the Branch Manager of the Huntington Beach, California office. Mr. Quinn informed the Division that Dana Capital was no longer operating and had initiated a winding down process of its operations on or about Tuesday, May 1, 2007.  On Monday, May 14, 2007, the Division was able to contact Mr. Joseph Terrezas, the individual designated by Dana Capital as the Branch Manager of the Newport Beach, California office. Mr. Terrezas informed the Division that Dana Capital had ceased operations as of April 30, 2007.  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.13(2) states: 	 (2) Licensees shall provide thirty days prior written notice of any change or closing of a Massachusetts location to the Commissioner and shall contain such other information as the Commissioner may require.  On Monday, May 21, 2007, the Division was able to contact Dana Smith, and other representatives of Dana Capital, via a conference call (the ""conference call""). According to Dana Smith, the Corporation had ceased operations on or around April 30, 2007.  	  	 Failure to Provide Information Requested Pursuant to a Division Inspection of the Corporation  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8 states, in part, that: 	 Each licensee shall, when directed by said commissioner, permit said commissioner or his duly authorized representative to inspect its relevant records and evidence of compliance with the provisions of this chapter or any rule or regulation issued hereunder and with any other law, rule or regulation applicable to the conduct of the business for which it is licensed under this chapter . . . . For the purposes of such inspection, said commissioner or his representative shall have access to the offices and place of business, books, accounts, papers, records and files of all such licensees.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.09(4) states in part: 	 (4)…A Licensee shall make such other statements and reports to the Commissioner as he or she may require from time to time…  During the conference call, representatives of Dana Capital indicated that Dana Capital, in conducting the licensed business, had operated a series of ""net branches,"" so called, whereby branch operations, purported to be conducted on behalf of Dana Capital, were performed by individuals or entities which were neither controlled or owned by Dana Capital.  During the conference call, representatives of Dana Capital were unable to provide any specific information regarding loan applications which remained pending as of April 30, 2007, and stated that they were unable to ascertain what individual branch offices had done with the applications that each office had taken prior to the commencement of dissolution procedures by Dana Capital.  During the conference call, the representatives stated that, as a general rule, individual applications were taken, processed and closed through individual branch offices. Furthermore, the only time the main office located at 8001 Irvine Center Drive, Suite 1200, Irvine, California, would be aware of any activity that occurred at a branch would be after the loan had closed and funded at which time the main office would receive a check from the ""title or closing company.""  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 48.03(1) states in part: 	 Each Licensee shall keep and use its books, records, and accounts in a manner which will allow the Commissioner to determine whether the Licensee is complying with the provisions of . . . General Laws chapter 255E and other provisions applicable to the conduct of the licensed business.  During the conference call, the representatives further stated that the Corporation had not been in contact with individual branches or their designated branch managers since the entering of dissolution procedures and were unaware of what was occurring at the individual branch offices. Furthermore, the Corporation could not identify the number and status of loan applications each individual branch may have taken prior to the dissolution of the Corporation.  During the conference call, Dana Capital stated that it was unable or unwilling to provide the Division with information regarding the location and status of any pending loan applications that each individual branch may have taken prior to the dissolution as there has been no communication with branch offices and their designated branch managers.  As a result of the aforementioned facts, the Division is unable to ascertain the current status of all pending loan applications and the extent of the harm, if any, to Massachusetts residential loan applicants.  During the conference call, Dana Capital was unable to provide access to or identify the specific location of all of the Corporation's books and records, specifically those relating to applications that may have recently been taken.  	  	 Failure to Provide Notification of Regulatory Action Entered in Another State  On or about April 19, 2007, The State of New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance (the ""New Jersey Banking and Insurance Department"") issued an Order to Cease and Desist and to Take Certain Actions & Order to Show Cause Why License Should Not be Revoked (the ""New Jersey Order"").  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.12(1)(c) states, in part: 	 A Licensee shall notify the Commissioner immediately, and in writing within one business day, of the occurrence of any of the following significant developments: . . . (c) Receiving notification of the institution of license . . . revocation procedures, or other formal or informal regulatory action, in any state against the Licensee, and the reasons thereof.  As of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, the Division has not received notification from Dana Capital of the issuance of the New Jersey Order against it by the New Jersey Banking and Insurance Department. 	 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 29, Dana Capital failed to provide the Commissioner with thirty days prior written notice of the Corporation's intention to cease business operations in violation of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.13(2).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 29, Dana Capital has failed to provide the Division with information regarding the status of applications that may have been taken prior to the dissolution of the corporation in violation of General Laws chapter 255E, section 8 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.09(4).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 29, Dana Capital has failed to provide the Division with information regarding the location of its books and records, specifically those relating to any ""pending loan applications,"" in violation of 209 CMR 48.03(1) relative to record keeping.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 29, Dana Capital failed to notify the Commissioner in writing, within one business day, that on April 19, 2007, the New Jersey Banking and Insurance Department entered the New Jersey Order against Dana Capital, in violation of 209 CMR 42.12(1)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 29, Dana Capital has failed to demonstrate the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.03(2)(c) and 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 29, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 Dana Capital has engaged in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that it is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage lender including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. ; and  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an  		ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to Dana Capital.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 29, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of Dana Capital's original mortgage lender and mortgage broker license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 29 present sufficient grounds for the revocation of Dana Capital mortgage lender and mortgage broker licenses pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.04(2)(b) and 209 CMR 42.07(2)(b). 	 ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that Dana Capital and any and all officers, directors, employees, independent contractors, or agents operating on behalf of Dana Capital, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker, as defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this TEMPORARY ORDER. Therefore, Dana Capital is ordered to immediately cease soliciting or accepting, either directly or indirectly, any residential mortgage loan applications from consumers for residential property located in Massachusetts.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Dana Capital, shall immediately place any fees previously collected from Massachusetts consumers relative to any pending mortgage loan applications in a separate escrow account maintained at a federally insured bank.

It being understood that ""no loss to the applicant"" shall mean that any loan which was closed by Dana Capital, as well as any application which was approved by the Corporation, shall be placed to a lender willing to fund, or close, the mortgage loan under the same terms and conditions extended by Dana Capital. In the event that no such placement can be made, Dana Capital shall either independently fund the mortgage loan under such terms and conditions or buy down the mortgage loan offered by the lender so that the applicant does not incur a loss as a result of such placement. Dana Capital shall obtain the prior approval of the Commissioner before placing such applications to the qualified lender(s).  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that in any instance in which Dana Capital failed to fund a loan closed by the Corporation and in which the consumer, prior to the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, obtained funding through an alternate lender, the Corporation shall reimburse each consumer the amount necessary to put the consumer in the same position as if Dana Capital had funded the mortgage loan under the terms and conditions agreed upon at the closing of the loan.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Dana Capital shall submit to the Commissioner a detailed record, prepared as of the date of submission, of all of the Corporation's pending residential mortgage loan applications on property located in Massachusetts. The records to be produced shall include all information on file regarding the Corporation's Massachusetts mortgage loan portfolio, including but not necessarily limited to, the following: 	 Within one (1) day of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, Dana Capital shall submit to the Commissioner all information on file as of the date of submission regarding the Corporation's portfolio of mortgage loans that were closed by Dana Capital prior to the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, but remain as yet unfunded. Such information shall include, but is not limited to, the following: The names of all individuals from whom Dana Capital processed an application and closed the residential mortgage loan, but failed to fund; the applicants' addresses and telephone numbers; the loan number; the amount of all prepaid loan fees submitted by the customer; the amount of each loan; the loan terms; the current funding status; the actual closing dates; the loan purpose (i.e. purchase or refinance); and identification of the applicable lender with whom each application will be placed. The record should include telephone numbers of contact persons at each lender who is familiar with the Corporation's submitted loans;  As soon as possible, but not later than five (5) days after the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, Dana Capital shall submit to the Commissioner (i) all information on file as of the date of submission regarding the Corporation's pipeline of pending mortgage loan applications including but not limited to, the following: The names of all individuals from whom Dana Capital has accepted an application for a residential mortgage loan; the applicants' addresses and telephone numbers; the loan number; the amount of all prepaid loan fees submitted by the customer; rate lock status; the amount of each loan; application status (i.e. filed, submitted to lenders, cleared to close, etc.); loan terms, if approved; scheduled closing dates; the loan purpose (i.e. purchase or refinance); and identification of the applicable lender with whom each application will be placed. The record should include telephone numbers of contact persons at each lender who is familiar with the Corporation's submitted loans.  On the last business day of each subsequent week after the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, Dana Capital shall provide the Commissioner with an updated, written status report of the mortgage loan applications identified above under subparagraphs 41(a) and 41(b). The form of the status report shall follow the format of the initial submission under subparagraphs 41(a) and 41(b) and shall indicate the final disposition of the loan application and include the final terms under which each approved loan is closed. The reporting requirement shall continue until each of the approved applications is placed with a lender and funded, funded by Dana Capital, or withdrawn by the applicant(s).  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Dana Capital shall immediately secure all pending mortgage loan application files and, to the extent that any original documents must be forwarded to the relevant mortgage lender pursuant to Paragraph 39 of this TEMPORARY ORDER, a copy of such document, correspondence, or paper relating to the mortgage loan shall be retained in the Corporation's books and records and shall be available to the Commissioner, in their entirety, upon request.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this TEMPORARY ORDER shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 30A.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such TEMPORARY ORDER shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from Dana Capital within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER. If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this TEMPORARY ORDER shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.

40,5/24/2021,2007,Temporary Cease and Desist,"The Lending Group, Inc.",Mortgage Lender,Failure to respond to requests for information/records,Babylon NY,https://www.mass.gov/temporary-order-to-cease-and-desist/the-lending-group-inc," COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  Suffolk, SS.  COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE LENDER  LICENSING  Docket No. 2007-018  FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  THE LENDING GROUP, INC  Jacksonville, Florida  Mortgage Lender License No. ML2581  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that THE LENDING GROUP, INC., (""The Lending Group"" or the ""Corporation""), located at 13901 Sutton Park Drive South, Suite 150, Jacksonville, Florida 32224 has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""Temporary Order"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage lender in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  The Lending Group is, and at all relevant times, has been a foreign corporation conducting business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The Lending Group's main office is located at 13901 Sutton Park Drive South, Suite 150, Jacksonville, Florida 32224.  The Lending Group is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage lender under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage lender license to The Lending Group to engage in the business of a mortgage lender in Massachusetts on or about April 6, 2004.  On Tuesday, May 29, 2007, a licensed Massachusetts mortgage broker (""Mortgage Broker"") notified the Division that The Lending Group, had failed to timely disburse loan proceeds in a purchase mortgage loan transaction involving a residential property in Massachusetts which the Mortgage Broker had placed with The Lending Group. The Mortgage Broker further informed the Division of the following alleged facts and circumstances: 	 The mortgage loan had closed and was scheduled to fund on Monday, May 21, 2007;  On Friday May 25, 2007, four days after the purchase money closing referenced above, The Lending Group sent an e-mail notice (the ""Notice"") to the title company and/or the closing attorney's office, which stated in part that [The Lending Group] had suspended ""all operations due to having no funding capacity.""  The Notice further stated that The Lending Group ""could have funding in place as early as next week, but… [The Lending Group] did not want to commit to an exact date."" In addition, the Notice stated that ""any and all loans that have not funded, will not fund with us unless, we secure our facility and re-close.""  Upon being informed of the above events by the Mortgage Broker, the Division reviewed the Web site maintained by The Lending Group at  www.tlg.com  which, as of an exact date that is unknown to the Division but at least as of Tuesday, May 29, 2007, confirmed the representations made by the Mortgage Broker. A copy of the notice which appeared on The Lending Group's Web site as of May 26, 2007 is attached as Exhibit 1. The notice stated, in part, that: 	 We regret to inform you that as of this time [The Lending Group] must suspend all operations due to having no funding capacity…we are in pursuit of additional funding sources, the timing and probability of these sources are unknown…We could have funding in place as early as next week but we do not want to commit to an exact date... Our plan at this time is to relieve all employees from their role at TLG while we try to meet the new requirements of our existing warehouse lender and try to secure new facilities. For now, to be clear, any and all loans that have not funded, will not fund with us unless we secure our facility and re-close. Any and all loans waiting to close will not close with us until we can guaranty funding.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12(1)(e) states in part: 	 A Licensee shall notify the Commissioner immediately, and in writing within one business day, of the occurrence of any of the following significant developments…expiration, termination or default, technical or otherwise, of any existing line of credit or warehouse credit agreement.  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.13(2) states: 	 Licensees shall provide thirty days prior written notice of any change or closing of a Massachusetts location to the Commissioner and shall contain such other information as the Commissioner may require.  Based upon information and belief, the loan referenced in subparagraph (4)(a), has not yet funded as of the effective date of this Temporary Order.  As of the issuance of this Temporary Order, The Lending Group has not notified the Division of the facts and circumstances set forth above.  As a result of the events described in Paragraphs 1 through 9, of this Temporary Order, on Wednesday, May 30, 2007, at approximately 11:16 a.m., the Division contacted John Miklos, General Counsel for The Lending Group via e-mail, and requested certain books and records. The Division further advised Mr. Miklos that the records were to be submitted to the Division no later than 10:00 a.m. eastern standard time (""EST""), on Friday, June 1, 2007. The books and records requested include but are not limited to: 	 A pipeline report of residential mortgage loan applications taken by The Lending Group, on properties located in all states;  Financial statements, including balance sheets and income statements as of the year ended December 31, 2006 and for the interim period from January 1, 2007 to February 28, 2007;  A list of the Corporation's warehouse lines of credit, with current balances and available funds for each line;  A list of loans, if any, that the Corporation was required to repurchase during the past twelve months; and  A list of loans, if any, that the Corporation closed but failed to fund in accordance with the terms of the mortgage note within the time permitted for such funding.  On Wednesday, May 30, 2007 at approximately 12:37 p.m., Mr. Miklos acknowledged receipt of the e-mail referenced in Paragraph 10 of this Temporary Order, and notified the Division that he would ""respond more definitely by day end.""  On the morning of Thursday, May 31, 2007, the Division received a phone call from Mr. James McCarthy, co-owner of The Lending Group. Mr. McCarthy was following up on the e-mail request to Mr. Miklos referenced in Paragraph 10 of this Temporary Order and stated that he was wondering ""why"" the Division needed the requested information. The Division notified Mr. McCarthy, that our request was as a result of the events referenced in Paragraphs 1 through 9 of this Temporary Order, to which he responded that the Corporation ""did not have any of the requested information available since the Corporation had closed.""  On Thursday, May 31, 2007, at approximately 12:39 p.m., Mr. Miklos responded, via e-mail, to the Division's original request referenced in Paragraph 10 of this Temporary Order, and stated that ""after careful review and discussing [the Division's] request with senior management of The Lending Group, Inc., a decision had been made to refer [the Division's] inquiry to local counsel [Tritt & Franson, P.A.].""  On Thursday, May 31, 2007, at approximately 3:17 p.m. the Division contacted the Arnold D. Tritt, Jr., of Tritt and Franson, P.A., via e-mail., and renewed the Division's request for the information referenced in Paragraph 10. The Division also requested information regarding the status of the Massachusetts mortgage loan referenced in Paragraph 4 of this Temporary Order.  On, Thursday, May 31, 2007, at approximately 3:25 p.m., Mr. Tritt e-mailed the Division an acknowledgement of receipt and further stated that ""[He] was unaware of the situation."" However, Mr. Tritt did note that Albert Franson, another Partner at the firm who ""most regularly works with The Lending Group, [was] out of this office [on Thursday],… and [would] report to [the Division] accordingly.""  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.09(4) states in part: 	 In addition to the reports required by law, a Licensee shall make such other statements and reports to the Commissioner as he or she may require from time to time  As of the date of this Temporary Order, the information requested in Paragraphs 10 and 14 of this order have not been provided to the Division. 	 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 17, The Lending Group's acts or practices of contracting with consumer(s), through the underwriting and subsequent execution of mortgage loan closing documents relating to Massachusetts residential property, and thereafter failing to fund the mortgage loan(s) may constitute unfair and/or deceptive acts or practices in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 17, due to the delay in funding contractual mortgage loan obligations The Lending Group has harmed a consumer, mortgage broker, and other parties in at least one residential mortgage loan transaction in the Commonwealth by engaging in acts or practices which may be unfair and/or deceptive in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 17, by contracting to originate mortgage loan(s) that The Lending Group did not have sufficient warehouse funds available to fund, or any other available alternative source of funds, The Lending Group has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices in violation of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.04(2)(b)(3).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 17, The Lending Group failed to notify the Commissioner within one business day of the expiration, termination, or default, technical or otherwise, of at least one existing line of credit or warehouse credit agreement, in violation of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12(1)(e).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 17, The Lending Group failed to provide the Commissioner with thirty days prior written notice of the Corporation's intention to cease business operations in violation of 209 CMR 42.13(2).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 17, The Lending Group failed to provide the Commissioner with the statements and reports requested, in violation of 209 CMR 42.09(4)  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 17, The Lending Group has failed to demonstrate the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.03(2)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 17, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 The Lending Group has engaged in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that it is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage lender including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. ; and  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to The Lending Group.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 17, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of The Lending Group's original mortgage lender license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 17 present sufficient grounds for the revocation of The Lending Group's mortgage lender license pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.04(2)(b). 	 ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that The Lending Group and any and all officers, directors, employees, independent contractors, or agents operating on behalf of The Lending Group, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of a mortgage lender, as defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Temporary Order. Therefore, The Lending Group is ordered to immediately cease soliciting or accepting, either directly or indirectly, any residential mortgage loan applications from consumers for residential property located in Massachusetts.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that The Lending Group, shall immediately place any fees previously collected from Massachusetts consumers relative to any pending mortgage loan applications in a separate escrow account maintained at a federally insured bank.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that The Lending Group shall immediately place with one or more qualified lender(s), with no loss to applicants, the following: (a) The Lending Group's entire portfolio of Massachusetts residential mortgage loans which were closed by The Lending Group, and remain unfunded as of the issuance of this Temporary Order; and (b) The Lending Group's entire pending application list of Massachusetts residential mortgage loans. It being understood that ""no loss to the applicant"" shall mean that any loan which was closed by The Lending Group, as well as any application which was approved by The Lending Group, shall be placed to a lender willing to fund, or close, the mortgage loan under the same terms and conditions extended by The Lending Group. In the event that no such placement can be made, The Lending Group shall either independently fund the mortgage loan under such terms and conditions or buy down the mortgage loan offered by the lender so that the applicant does not incur a loss as a result of such placement. The Lending Group shall obtain the prior approval of the Commissioner before placing such applications to the qualified lender(s).  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that in any instance in which The Lending Group failed to fund a closed loan and in which the consumer, prior to the effective date of this Temporary Order, obtained funding through an alternate lender, The Lending Group shall reimburse each consumer the amount necessary to put the consumer in the same position as if The Lending Group had funded the mortgage loan under the terms and conditions agreed upon at the closing of the loan.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that The Lending Group shall submit to the Commissioner a detailed record, prepared as of the date of submission, of all of The Lending Group's pending residential mortgage loan applications on property located in Massachusetts.

The record should include telephone numbers of contact persons at each lender who is familiar with The Lending Group's submitted loans; and (ii) The Lending Group's balance sheet and year-to-date income statement, prepared as of the date of submission, and attested by a duly authorized officer of The Lending Group. The balance sheet should indicate The Lending Group's cash position at each of its depository banks as well as The Lending Group's bank account numbers; and  On the last business day of each subsequent week after the effective date of this Temporary Order, The Lending Group shall provide the Commissioner with an updated, written status report of the mortgage loan applications identified above under subparagraphs 31(a) and 31(b).

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that The Lending Group shall immediately secure all pending mortgage loan application files and, to the extent that any original documents must be forwarded to the relevant mortgage lender pursuant to Paragraph 29 of this TEMPORARY ORDER, a copy of such document, correspondence, or paper relating to the mortgage loan shall be retained in The Lending Group's books and records and shall be available to the Commissioner, in their entirety, upon request.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Temporary Order shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 30A.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such Temporary Order shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from The Lending Group within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this Temporary Order. If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this Temporary Order shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE LENDER AND  MORTGAGE BROKER  LICENSING  Docket No. 2007-022  FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  AMERICAN HOME MORTGAGE CORP. d/b/a American Brokers Conduit;  Melville, New York  Mortgage Company License No(s).

(""American Home Mortgage Acceptance""); and (c) AMERICAN HOME MORTGAGE VENUTURES LLC (""American Home Mortgage Ventures""), all of which are located at 538 Broadhollow Road, Melville, New York, have engaged in, or are engaging in, or are about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""Temporary Order"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  American Home Mortgage, American Home Mortgage Acceptance, and American Home Mortgage Ventures are, and at all relevant times, have been affiliated, foreign corporations conducting business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts with main offices located at 538 Broadhollow Road, Melville, New York.  American Home Mortgage is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage lender and mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage company license to American Home Mortgage to engage in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts on or about March 21, 2000, with license no. MC1368.  American Home Mortgage Acceptance is an affiliate of American Home Mortgage and is licensed as a mortgage lender under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage lender license to American Home Mortgage Acceptance to engage in the business of a mortgage lender on or about August 17, 2004, with license no. ML2664.  American Home Mortgage Ventures is an affiliate of American Home Mortgage and is licensed as a mortgage lender and mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage broker and mortgage lender license to American Home Mortgage Acceptance to engage in the business of a mortgage lender on or about July 24, 2007, with license no. MC5032.  American Home Mortgage operates additional office locations from which the Corporation conducts its Massachusetts mortgage lender and mortgage broker business. According to records maintained on file with the Division, American Home Mortgage currently possesses forty four (44) additional mortgage lender and mortgage broker licenses from the Commissioner for locations operated both in Massachusetts as well as outside the Commonwealth.  American Home Mortgage is a wholly-owned subsidiary of American Home Mortgage Holdings, Inc., which, in turn, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of American Home Mortgage Investment Corp., a publicly traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. 	 A. Failure to Fund Certain Residential Mortgage Loan Obligations in Massachusetts  On July 31, 2007, representatives from the Division, by and through discussions held with representatives of other state banking and mortgage lending regulators, contacted American Home Mortgage to schedule a telephone conference call to be held on August 1, 2007 with senior executives of American Home Mortgage, to discuss concerns regarding the Corporation's financial condition and its apparent inability to fund mortgage loans (""August 1, 2007 teleconference"").  During the August 1, 2007 teleconference, the Division requested that American Home Mortgage provide a pipeline report regarding mortgage loans involving residential property in Massachusetts. In response to that request, on August 1, 2007, American Home Mortgage provided the Division with a pipeline report that indicated that, as of July 31, 2007, the Corporation failed to disburse loan proceeds, or is about to fail to disburse loan proceeds, or otherwise fund, as many as thirty-eight (38) mortgage loan transactions involving residential property in Massachusetts for which closings had taken place or are scheduled to occur.  Based upon information and belief, the loans referenced in Paragraph 9, have not yet funded as of the effective date of this Temporary Order. 	 B. Impairment of Lender Lines of Credit Used to Fund American Home Mortgage's Lending Operations  On July 31, 2007, at approximately 7:28 p.m., American Home Mortgage's counsel faxed to the Division a letter advising the Division that, as of July 31, 2007, American Home Mortgage ""has temporarily ceased funding loans due to an inability to draw upon its warehouse facilities.""  During the August 1, 2007 teleconference, American Home Mortgage's executives stated that they became aware of the impairment of the Corporation's warehouse line of credit on or about July 19, 2007.  A line of credit used by a mortgage lender enables the entity to fund mortgage loans prior to selling them to an investor. Without access to its lines of credit, and in the absence of the mortgage lender independently maintaining sufficient reserves and liquidity positions on its books to fund such loans, the mortgage lender would be unable to meet its funding commitments, negating its ability to meet contractual obligations to fund mortgage loans.  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.12(1)(e) states, in part: 	 A Licensee shall notify the Commissioner immediately, and in writing within one business day, of the occurrence of any of the following significant developments: . . . (e) Expiration, termination or default, technical or otherwise, of any existing line of credit or warehouse credit agreement.  Prior to the July 31, 2007 letter, American Home Mortgage had not notified the Division of the any suspension, default, and/or termination of the Corporation's line(s) of credit. 	 C. Failure to Maintain Minimum Standards of Financial Responsibility for Holding a Mortgage Company License in Massachusetts  According to a news release issued by American Home Mortgage Investment Corp. on July 31, 2007 (the ""News Release""), American Home Mortgage was ""unable to borrow on its credit facilities and was unable to fund its lending obligations [on July 30, 2007] of approximately $300 million."" The News Release also stated that American Home Mortgage did not anticipate funding approximately $450 to $500 million of residential mortgage loan transactions scheduled for July 31, 2007.  The News Release stated that American Home Mortgage's ""lenders have initiated margin calls in response to the decline in the collateral value of certain of the [Corporation's] loans and securities held in its portfolio."" The News Release further stated that the Corporation ""has received and paid very significant margin calls in the last three weeks and has substantial unpaid margin calls pending.""  During the August 1, 2007 teleconference, American Home Mortgage reported that, in the absence of obtaining additional funding facilities, American Home Mortgage's current liquidity position would not permit American Home Mortgage to satisfy current margin calls or to honor repurchase obligations from its investors.  On or about July 27, 2007, the New York Stock Exchange temporarily halted trading in shares of American Home Mortgage Investment Corp. On or about July 31, 2007, trading in such shares resumed. 	 D. Engaging in Unsafe and Unsound Practices in the Operation of the Licensed Business  On August 1, 2007, pursuant to a conference call held with other state banking and mortgage lending regulators, the Division was informed that American Home Mortgage failed to fund mortgage loans on residential property in the state of Connecticut.  On August 1, 2007, the Connecticut Banking Department provided the Division with American Home Mortgage's pipeline report relative to mortgage loans involving residential property in the state of Connecticut, which had been prepared and submitted by the Corporation to Connecticut regulators. The pipeline report indicates that the Corporation failed to fund as many as forty-two (42) closed loans.  During the August 1, 2007 teleconference, executives of American Home Mortgage stated that the Corporation has no funding source in place that would enable the Corporation to fund the closed loans in the pipeline, absent intervention from an outside investor.  On August 1, 2007, Counsel to American Home Mortgage sent an email to Connecticut regulators regarding the Corporation and requested that the email be distributed to other regulators. The email was received by the Division on the evening of August 1, 2007. The email reported that the Corporation ""is in discussions with several national lenders regarding transferring some or all of its pipeline so that loans can continue to be processed, underwritten and funded."" 	 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 23, by contracting to originate mortgage loan(s) for which American Home Mortgage did not have sufficient funds available to meet its funding obligations, American Home Mortgage has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices in violation of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.04(2)(b)(3).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 though 23, American Home Mortgage failed to notify the Commissioner, in writing, within one business day of the expiration, termination or default, technical or otherwise, of any existing line of credit or warehouse credit agreement, in violation of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12(1)(e).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 23, American Home Mortgage's acts or practices of contracting with consumer(s), through the underwriting and subsequent execution of mortgage loan closing documents relating to Massachusetts residential property, and thereafter failing to fund the mortgage loan(s) may constitute unfair and/or deceptive acts or practices in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 23, due to the delay and/or failure in funding contractual mortgage loan obligations American Home Mortgage has harmed consumers, mortgage brokers, and/or other parties in as many as thirty- eight (38) residential mortgage loan transactions in the Commonwealth by engaging in acts or practices which may be unfair and/or deceptive in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 23, American Home Mortgage has failed to maintain the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.03(2)(c) and 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 23, due to the relationship of the officers, directors, and principals of American Home Mortgage and American Home Mortgage Acceptance, the Division is unable to conclude that American Home Mortgage Acceptance has demonstrated the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.03(2)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 23, due to the relationship of the officers, directors, and principals of American Home Mortgage and American Home Mortgage Ventures, the Division is unable to conclude that American Home Mortgage Ventures has demonstrated the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.03(2)(c) and 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 23, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 American Home Mortgage, American Home Mortgage Acceptance and American Home Mortgage Ventures have engaged in, are engaging in, or are about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that they are not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. ; and  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to American Home Mortgage Acceptance, American Home Mortgage Ventures, and American Home Mortgage.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 23, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of American Home Mortgage's, American Home Mortgage Acceptance's and American Home Mortgage Ventures' original mortgage lender and/or mortgage broker license application(s), the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license(s). Further, the facts and conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 23 present sufficient grounds for the revocation of American Home Mortgage's American Home Mortgage Acceptance's and American Home Mortgage Ventures' mortgage lender and/or mortgage broker license(s), pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.04(2)(b) and 209 CMR 42.07(2)(b). 	 ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that American Home Mortgage, American Home Mortgage Acceptance and American Home Mortgage Ventures and any and all officers, directors, employees, independent contractors, or agents operating on behalf of American Home Mortgage, American Home Mortgage Acceptance and American Home Mortgage Ventures, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of a mortgage lender and/or mortgage broker, as defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Temporary Order.

42,8/2/2021,2007,Temporary Cease and Desist,Alliance Mortgage Banking Corp. dba Alliance Capital,"Mortgage Lender,Mortgage Broker",Misleading language in solicitation,Quincy MA,https://www.mass.gov/temporary-order-to-cease-and-desist/alliance-mortgage-banking-corp-dba-alliance-capital," COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  Suffolk, SS.  COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE LENDER AND  MORTGAGE BROKER  LICENSING  Docket No. 2007-021  FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  ALLIANCE MORTGAGE BANKING CORP. D/B/A ALLIANCE CAPITAL  Levittown, New York  Mortgage Lender and Mortgage Broker  License Nos. MC3965; MC3966  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that ALLIANCE MORTGAGE BANKING CORP. D/B/A ALLIANCE CAPITAL, (""Alliance Mortgage"" or the ""Corporation""), located at 3601 Hempstead Turnpike, Suite 305, Levittown, New York has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""Temporary Order"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  Alliance Mortgage is, and at all relevant times has been, a foreign corporation conducting business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Alliance Mortgage's main office is located at 3601 Hempstead Turnpike, Suite 305, Levittown, New York.  Alliance Mortgage is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage lender and mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, on or about June 10, 2005 the Commissioner issued mortgage company licenses to Alliance Mortgage to engage in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts at 3601 Hempstead Turnpike, Suite 305, Levittown, New York and at 2735 Buffalo Road, Rochester, New York (with license numbers MC3965 and MC3966, respectively). 	 A. Failure to Fund Loans  On or about June 22, 2007, pursuant to verbal discussions with state regulators from New Jersey and New York, the Division became aware that Alliance Mortgage had allegedly failed to timely disburse loan proceeds in residential mortgage loan transactions in both New Jersey and New York.  On or about June 22, 2007, pursuant to verbal discussions with state regulators from New Hampshire and New York, the Division became aware that Alliance Mortgage had allegedly drafted and delivered several checks to both borrowers and settlement agents in New Hampshire and New York that had failed to clear due to insufficient funds being maintained in the account from which such checks had been drawn. 	 B. Failure to Provide Notification of Regulatory Actions Entered in Other States  On Thursday, June 28, 2007, the Division became aware that the New York State Banking Department (""New York Banking Department"") suspended Alliance Mortgage's mortgage banker license on Wednesday, June 27, 2007, due to the corporation's failure to fund residential mortgage loans in the state of New York. The Division became aware of the suspension via an email sent by the New York Banking Department to other state banking regulators on June 28, 2007 (""New York Banking Department email"").  According to the State of New York Banking Department Weekly Bulletin of June 29, 2007 (the ""Bulletin""), Alliance Mortgage ""failed to disburse loan proceeds on loans closed on New York properties, a violation of Part 38.7(a)(8) of the General Regulations of the Banking Board."" According to the Bulletin, Alliance Mortgage's mortgage banker's license has been suspended and a hearing for revocation will be scheduled.  In the New York Banking Department email, the New York Banking Department noted that the action referenced in Paragraph 6 of this Temporary Order ""was taken at this early stage because of [Alliance Mortgage's] lack of responsiveness to inquiries."" Such inquiries were made pursuant to the New York Banking Department's authority to conduct examinations of its licensed mortgage bankers.  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.12(1)(c) states, in part: 	 A Licensee shall notify the Commissioner immediately, and in writing within one business day, of the occurrence of any of the following significant developments: . . . (c) Receiving notification of the institution of license . . . suspension or revocation procedures, or other formal or informal regulatory action, in any state against the Licensee, and the reasons thereof.  As of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, the Division has not received notification from Alliance Mortgage of the occurrence of the events referenced above in Paragraphs 6 through 8 of this TEMPORARY ORDER. 	 C. Impairment of Lender Lines of Credit Used to Fund Alliance Mortgage's Lending Operations  According to the New York Banking Department email, a lending institution suspended Alliance Mortgage's warehouse line of credit ""during the first week of June 2007.""  A line of credit used by a mortgage lender enables the entity to fund mortgage loans prior to selling them to an investor. Without access to its lines of credit, and in the absence of the mortgage lender independently maintaining sufficient reserves and liquidity positions on its books to fund such loans, the mortgage lender would be unable to meet its funding commitments, negating its ability to meet contractual obligations to fund mortgage loans.  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.12(1)(e) states, in part: 	 A Licensee shall notify the Commissioner immediately, and in writing within one business day, of the occurrence of any of the following significant developments: . . . (e) Expiration, termination or default, technical or otherwise, of any existing line of credit or warehouse credit agreement.  As of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, the Division has not received notification from Alliance Mortgage of the occurrence of the event referenced above in Paragraph 11 of this TEMPORARY ORDER. 	 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 14, by contracting to originate mortgage loan(s) that Alliance Mortgage did not have sufficient warehouse funds available to fund, or any other available alternative source of funds, Alliance Mortgage has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices in violation of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.04(2)(b)(3).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 14, Alliance Mortgage failed to notify the Commissioner in writing, within one business day, that on June 27, 2007, the New York Banking Department suspended the Corporation's mortgage banking license, in violation of 209 CMR 42.12(1)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 14, Alliance Mortgage failed to notify the Commissioner within one business day of the expiration, termination, or default, technical or otherwise, of at least one existing line of credit or warehouse credit agreement, in violation of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12(1)(e).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 14, Alliance Mortgage has failed to demonstrate the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.03(2)(c) and 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 14, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 Alliance Mortgage is engaging in, has engaged in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that it is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. ; and  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to Alliance Mortgage.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 14, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of Alliance Mortgage's original mortgage lender and mortgage broker licenses application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 14 present sufficient grounds for the revocation of Alliance Mortgage's mortgage lender and mortgage broker licenses pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.04(2)(b) and 209 CMR 42.07(2)(b). 	 ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that Alliance Mortgage and any and all, officers, directors, employees, independent contractors, or agents operating on behalf of Alliance Mortgage, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker, as defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this TEMPORARY ORDER. Therefore, Alliance Mortgage is ordered to immediately cease soliciting or accepting, either directly or indirectly, any residential mortgage loan applications from consumers for residential property located in Massachusetts.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Alliance Mortgage, shall immediately place any fees previously collected from Massachusetts consumers relative to any pending mortgage loan applications in a separate escrow account maintained at a federally insured bank.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Alliance Mortgage shall immediately place with one or more qualified broker(s) or lender(s), as appropriate based on the status of the application and with no loss to applicants, all of its pending Massachusetts residential mortgage loan applications. It being understood that ""no loss to the applicant"" shall mean that any loan which may have been closed by Alliance Mortgage and remains unfunded, as well as any pending application which has been approved by the Corporation but has not yet closed, shall be placed to a lender willing to fund, or close, the mortgage loan under the same terms and conditions extended by Alliance Mortgage. In the event that no such placement can be made, Alliance Mortgage shall either independently fund the mortgage loan under such terms and conditions or buy down the mortgage loan offered by the lender so that the applicant does not incur a loss as a result of such placement. Alliance Mortgage shall obtain the prior approval of the Commissioner before placing such applications to the qualified lender(s) or broker(s) as appropriate.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that in any instance in which Alliance Mortgage failed to fund a loan closed by the Corporation and in which the consumer, prior to the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, obtained funding through an alternate lender, the Corporation shall reimburse each consumer the amount necessary to put the consumer in the same position as if Alliance Mortgage had funded the mortgage loan under the terms and conditions agreed upon at the closing of the loan.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Alliance Mortgage shall submit to the Commissioner a detailed record, prepared as of the date of submission, of all of the Corporation's pending residential mortgage loan applications on property located in Massachusetts. The records to be produced shall include all information on file regarding the Corporation's Massachusetts mortgage loan portfolio, including but not necessarily limited to, the following: 	 Within one (1) day of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, Alliance Mortgage shall submit to the Commissioner all information on file as of the date of submission regarding the Corporation's portfolio of mortgage loans that were closed by Alliance Mortgage prior to the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, but remain as yet unfunded. Such information shall include, but is not limited to, the following: The names of all individuals from whom Alliance Mortgage processed an application and closed the residential mortgage loan, but failed to fund; the applicants' addresses and telephone numbers; the loan number; the amount of all prepaid loan fees submitted by the customer; the amount of each loan; the loan terms; the current funding status; the actual closing dates; the loan purpose (i.e. purchase or refinance); and identification of the applicable lender with whom each application will be placed. The record should include telephone numbers of contact persons at each lender who is familiar with the Corporation's submitted loans;  As soon as possible, but not later than five (5) days after the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, Alliance Mortgage shall submit to the Commissioner all information on file as of the date of submission regarding the Corporation's pipeline of pending mortgage loan applications including but not limited to, the following: The names of all individuals from whom Alliance Mortgage has accepted an application for a residential mortgage loan; the applicants' addresses and telephone numbers; the loan number; the amount of all prepaid loan fees submitted by the customer; rate lock status; the amount of each loan; application status (i.e. filed, submitted to lenders, cleared to close, etc.); loan terms, if approved; scheduled closing dates; the loan purpose (i.e. purchase or refinance); and identification of the applicable lender or broker with whom each application will be placed. The record should include telephone numbers of contact persons at each lender or broker who is familiar with the Corporation's submitted loans;  On the last business day of each subsequent week after the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, Alliance Mortgage shall provide the Commissioner with an updated, written status report of the mortgage loan applications identified above under subparagraphs 25(a) and 25(b). The form of the status report shall follow the format of the initial submission under subparagraphs 25(a) and 25(b) and shall indicate the final disposition of the loan application and include the final terms under which each approved loan is closed. The reporting requirement shall continue until each of the approved applications is placed with a lender and funded, funded by Alliance Mortgage, or withdrawn by the applicant(s); and  Within one (1) day of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, Alliance Mortgage shall submit to the Commissioner Alliance Mortgage's balance sheet and year-to-date income statement, prepared as of the date of submission, and attested by a duly authorized officer of the Corporation. The balance sheet should indicate Alliance Mortgage's cash position at each of its depository banks as well as Alliance Mortgage's bank account numbers.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Alliance Mortgage shall immediately secure all pending mortgage loan application files and, to the extent that any original documents must be forwarded to the relevant mortgage lender pursuant to Paragraph 23 of this TEMPORARY ORDER, a copy of such document, correspondence, or paper relating to the mortgage loan shall be retained in the Corporation's books and records and shall be available to the Commissioner, in their entirety, upon request.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this TEMPORARY ORDER shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 30A.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such TEMPORARY ORDER shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from Alliance Mortgage within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER. If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this TEMPORARY ORDER shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.

The Parties  Aegis Mortgage Corporation  Aegis Mortgage Corporation is a nationwide mortgage banking company in the business of originating, purchasing, selling, servicing and securitizing mortgage loans through a diverse network of distribution channels organized as wholly owned subsidiaries. Aegis Mortgage Corporation is registered with the Commissioner as a loan servicer under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93, section 24A.  Aegis Wholesale and Aegis Funding (collectively, the ""Aegis Corporations"") are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Aegis Mortgage Corporation. 	 Aegis Wholesale Corporation  Aegis Wholesale is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage lender under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage lender license to Aegis Wholesale to engage in the business of a mortgage lender in Massachusetts on or about November 19, 2002.  Aegis Wholesale is, and at all relevant times has been, a foreign corporation conducting business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts with its main office located at 3250 Briarpark Drive, 4  th  Floor, Houston, Texas.  Aegis Wholesale operates additional office locations from which it conducts the mortgage lender business. According to records maintained on file with the Division, Aegis Wholesale currently possesses nine (9) additional mortgage lender licenses from the Commissioner for business offices located outside the Commonwealth. 	 Aegis Funding Corporation  Aegis Funding is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage lender under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage lender license to Aegis Funding to engage in the business of a mortgage lender on or about November 19, 2002.  Aegis Funding is, and at all relevant times has been, a foreign corporation conducting business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts with its main office located at 3250 Briarpark Drive, Houston, Texas.  According to records maintained on file with the Division, Aegis Funding currently possesses one (1) additional mortgage lender license from the Commissioner for an additional location outside the Commonwealth from which Aegis Funding conducts its Massachusetts mortgage lender business.  Aegis Wholesale and Aegis Funding are operated, in part, by certain common individuals who perform in the capacity of executive officers and directors of both corporations. 	 B. Failure to Fund Certain Residential Mortgage Loan Obligations in Massachusetts  On or about Monday, July 16, 2007, the Division received notice from another state banking regulator that the Aegis Corporations may have ceased accepting residential mortgage loan applications. In response to this information, on Tuesday, July 17, 2007, representatives from the Division and representatives of other state banking and mortgage lending regulators, held a telephone conference call with Michael Balog, Executive Vice President and General Counsel of Aegis Mortgage Corporation and Michael Massella, President of Production of Aegis Mortgage Corporation to discuss the current financial condition of the Aegis Corporations (""July 17  th  telephone conference"").  During the July 17  th  telephone conference, Mr. Balog and Mr. Massella reported to the Division and the other state banking regulators that Aegis Mortgage Corporation was engaged in the process of dissolving Aegis Funding and that Aegis Mortgage Corporation intended to continue to operate Aegis Wholesale as a wholesale lending platform.  On Monday August 6, 2007, the Division became aware via a news article distributed by the Associated Press that Aegis Mortgage Corporation had ""suspended all loan originations amid the worsening housing and credit markets."" The article further states in part that, ""the company had notified brokers who serve as customers that Aegis would not be able to fund loans currently in the pipeline.""  On Tuesday, August 7, 2007, the Division, through communications with another state banking department, became aware of an e-mail that Aegis Mortgage Corporation had distributed through its mortgage broker network which stated in part that, ""Aegis Mortgage Corporation has stopped funding loans and accepting applications as of today August 6, 2007. Any branches that have any loans submitted to this lender should place your loans with another lender as they will not be funded.""  The information reported in the August 7  th  e-mail referenced above applied to transactions pending with Aegis Wholesale. Based upon information and belief, Aegis Funding had already ceased accepting applications prior to August 7, 2007.  On Tuesday, August 7, 2007, the Division received a separate e-mail from representatives of the Aegis Corporations stating, in part, that Aegis Wholesale had failed to disburse loan proceeds, or otherwise fund, at least four hundred (400) mortgage loan transactions across the country involving residential property for which closings had already taken place. (""August 7  th  e-mail"").  The August 7  th  e-mail stated in part that, ""Aegis has stopped accepting loan applications from mortgage brokers funding loans."" The e-mail stated that the Aegis Corporations' actions were, ""in large measure due to the illiquidity in the mortgage market.""  The August 7  th  e-mail further stated that the Aegis Corporations' could ""offer no assurances that other lenders [would] be willing to make, fund or purchase these potential loans.""  On Tuesday, August 7, 2007, representatives from the Division and representatives of other state banking and mortgage lending regulators, held a telephone conference call with senior executives of the Aegis Corporations to discuss concerns raised as a result of the events referenced in Paragraphs 11 through 18 of this Temporary Order. (""August 7  th  telephone conference"").  During the August 7, 2007 telephone conference, the Division was informed that Aegis Wholesale had failed to disburse loan proceeds in, or otherwise fund, one (1) mortgage loan transaction involving residential property in Massachusetts for which a closing had taken place.  During the August 7  th  telephone conference, representatives of the Aegis Corporations' reported that Aegis Wholesale had ceased funding loans on or about Wednesday, August 1, 2007.  The Division refrained from taking any formal action against the Aegis Corporations' in response to the information reported during the July 17  th  telephone conference, in part, based upon the receipt of a letter dated July 23, 2007 from Madeleine, LLC, the majority shareholder of the Aegis Corporations, whereby Madeleine, LLC stated its continued intention to capitalize and support the Aegis Corporations. Madeleine, LLC is controlled by Cerberus Capital Management.  Based upon the conditions and information reported in Paragraphs 13 through 21, it now appears that the Aegis Corporations majority shareholder is unable or unwilling to contribute the additional capital necessary to permit the Aegis Corporations' to finance its closed mortgage loan obligations.  Based upon information and belief, the loans referenced in Paragraphs 16 and 20 have not yet funded as of the effective date of this Temporary Order. 	 C. Impairment of Lender Lines of Credit Used to Fund the Aegis Corporations' Lending Operations and Failure to Maintain Minimum Standards of Financial Responsibility for Holding a Mortgage Company License in Massachusetts  During the August 7, 2007 teleconference, the Aegis Corporations reported that the Aegis Corporations current liquidity position would not permit the Aegis Corporations to satisfy current margin calls from its lenders.  Based upon the conditions and information reported in Paragraphs 13 through 21, it remains uncertain whether, or to what extent, the Aegis Corporations will be able to satisfy additional margin calls and/or to honor loan repurchase obligations in the absence of liquidity which was described by the Aegis Corporations.  During the August 7, 2007 telephone conference, the senior executives of the Aegis Corporations stated that at least one warehouse line of credit had been suspended and/or terminated, however the representatives were unable to provide any additional information regarding the status of the Aegis Corporations' remaining warehouse lines of credit and the impact the events referenced in Paragraphs 13 through 24 of this Temporary Order have had on the financial status of the Aegis Corporations.  A line of credit used by a mortgage lender enables the entity to fund mortgage loans prior to selling them to an investor. Without access to its lines of credit, and in the absence of the mortgage lender independently maintaining sufficient reserves and liquidity positions on its books to fund such loans, the mortgage lender would be unable to meet its funding commitments, negating its ability to meet contractual obligations to fund mortgage loans.  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.12(1)(e) states, in part: 	 A Licensee shall notify the Commissioner immediately, and in writing within one business day, of the occurrence of any of the following significant developments: . . . (e) Expiration, termination or default, technical or otherwise, of any existing line of credit or warehouse credit agreement.  Prior to the August 7  th  telephone conference, the Aegis Corporations had not notified the Division of the any suspension, default, and/or termination of the Corporation's line(s) of credit. 	 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 30 by contracting to originate mortgage loan(s) for which Aegis Wholesale did not have sufficient funds available to meet its funding obligations, Aegis Wholesale has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices in violation of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.04(2)(b)(3).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 though 30, Aegis Wholesale, failed to notify the Commissioner, in writing, within one business day of the expiration, termination or default, technical or otherwise, of any existing line of credit or warehouse credit agreement, in violation of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12(1)(e).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 30, Aegis Wholesale's acts or practices of contracting with consumer(s), through the underwriting and subsequent execution of mortgage loan closing documents relating to Massachusetts residential property, and thereafter failing to fund the mortgage loan(s) may constitute unfair and/or deceptive acts or practices in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 30, due to the delay and/or failure in funding contractual mortgage loan obligations Aegis Wholesale has harmed consumers, mortgage brokers, and/or other parties in at least one (1) residential mortgage loan transactions in the Commonwealth by engaging in acts or practices which may be unfair and/or deceptive in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 30, due to the interlocking relationship of the officers and directors of Aegis Wholesale and Aegis Funding as more fully set forth in Paragraph 10, the Division is unable to conclude that the Aegis Corporations have maintained the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the businesses will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.03(2)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 30, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 The Aegis Corporations have engaged in, are engaging in, or are about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that they are not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage lender including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. ; and  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to the Aegis Corporations.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 30, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of the Aegis Corporations' original mortgage lender license application(s), the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license(s). Further, the facts and conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 30 present sufficient grounds for the revocation of the Aegis Corporations' mortgage lender license(s), pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.04(2)(b). 	 ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that the Aegis Corporations and any and all officers, directors, employees, or agents operating on behalf of the Aegis Corporations, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of a mortgage lender, as defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Temporary Order.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE LENDER AND  MORTGAGE BROKER  LICENSING  Docket No. 2007-025  FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  FIRST MAGNUS FINANCIAL CORPORATION  Tucson, Arizona  Mortgage Company License No(s). MC1896,  et al .     The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner') having determined that FIRST MAGNUS FINANCIAL CORPORATION., (""First Magnus Financial"" or the ""Corporation""), located at 603 North Wilmot Road ,Tucson, Arizona has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00 et seq., hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""Temporary Order"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  First Magnus Financial is, and at all relevant times, has been a foreign corporation conducting business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. First Magnus Financial's main office is located at 603 North Wilmot Road, Tucson, Arizona.  First Magnus Financial is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage lender and mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage company license to First Magnus Financial to engage in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts on or about September 7, 2001, with license no. MC1896  First Magnus Financial maintains additional office locations from which the Corporation conducts the mortgage lender and mortgage broker business. According to records maintained on file with the Division, First Magnus Financial currently possesses seven (7) additional mortgage lender and mortgage broker licenses from the Commissioner for locations operated both in Massachusetts as well as outside the Commonwealth.  On Thursday, August 16, 2007, the Division was notified via an e-mail sent by the Iowa Division of Banking that First Magnus Financial ceased funding Residential Mortgage Loans as of Thursday, August 16, 2007. In the e-mail, the Iowa Division of Banking included a forwarded, undated, e-mail from the management team of First Magnus Financial that had evidently been sent to First Magnus employees and associates.  The e-mail message referenced in Paragraph 5 states in part: ""First Magnus has been forced to stop accepting new loan applications or funding loans effective today.""  The Division reviewed the web site maintained by First Magnus Financial at  www.firstmagnus.com  which, as of an exact date that is unknown to the Division but at least as of Thursday, August 16, 2007, confirmed the representations made in the e-mail referenced in Paragraph 5. A copy of the notice which appeared on First Magnus Financial's Web site as of Thursday August 16, 2007 is attached as Exhibit 1. The notice stated, in part:  	""In light of the collapse of the secondary mortgage market, First Magnus [Financial] will not fund any future mortgage loans, and is no longer…funding any mortgage loans previously originated and not yet funded""  	   The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.13(2) states: 	 Licensees shall provide thirty days prior written notice of any change or closing of a Massachusetts location to the Commissioner and shall contain such other information as the Commissioner may require.  First Magnus Financial did not provide prior notice to the Division that the Corporation was ceasing operations.  On Friday, August 17, 2007, a licensed Massachusetts mortgage broker (""Mortgage Broker"") notified the Division that First Magnus Financial had failed to timely disburse loan proceeds in a mortgage refinance loan transaction involving a residential property in Massachusetts which the Mortgage Broker had placed with First Magnus Financial. The Mortgage Broker informed the Division that the loan had closed on August 14, 2007 and was scheduled to fund on August 17, 2007.  Based upon information and belief, the loan referenced in Paragraph 10 has not yet funded as of the effective date of this Temporary Order. 	 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 11, First Magnus Financial's acts or practices of contracting with consumer(s), through the underwriting and subsequent execution of mortgage loan closing documents relating to Massachusetts residential property, and thereafter failing to fund the mortgage loan(s) may constitute unfair and/or deceptive acts or practices in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 11, due to the delay in funding contractual mortgage loan obligations First Magnus Financial has harmed a consumer, mortgage broker, and other parties in at least one residential mortgage loan transaction in the Commonwealth by engaging in acts or practices which may be unfair and/or deceptive in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 11, by contracting to originate mortgage loan(s) that First Magnus Financial did not have sufficient warehouse funds available to fund, or any other available alternative source of funds, First Magnus Financial has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices in violation of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.04(2)(b)3.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 11, First Magnus Financial failed to provide the Commissioner with thirty days prior written notice of the Corporation's intention to cease business operations in violation of 209 CMR 42.13(2).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 11, First Magnus Financial has failed to demonstrate the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.03(2)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 11, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 First Magnus Financial has engaged in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that it is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. ; and  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to First Magnus Financial.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 11, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of First Magnus Financial's original mortgage lender and mortgage broker license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 11 present sufficient grounds for the revocation of First Magnus Financial's mortgage lender and mortgage broker license pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.04(2)(b). 	 ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that First Magnus Financial and any and all officers, directors, employees, or agents operating on behalf of First Magnus Financial, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker, as defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Temporary Order. Therefore, First Magnus Financial is ordered to immediately cease soliciting or accepting, either directly or indirectly, any residential mortgage loan applications from consumers for residential property located in Massachusetts.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that First Magnus Financial, shall immediately place any fees previously collected from Massachusetts consumers relative to any pending mortgage loan applications in a separate escrow account maintained at a federally insured bank.

It being understood that ""no loss to the applicant"" shall mean that any loan which was closed by First Magnus Financial, as well as any application which was approved by First Magnus Financial, shall be placed to a lender willing to fund, or close, the mortgage loan under the same terms and conditions extended by First Magnus Financial. In the event that no such placement can be made, First Magnus Financial shall either independently fund the mortgage loan under such terms and conditions or buy down the mortgage loan offered by the lender so that the applicant does not incur a loss as a result of such placement. First Magnus Financial shall obtain the prior approval of the Commissioner before placing such applications to the qualified lender(s) or broker(s) as appropriate.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that in any instance in which First Magnus Financial failed to fund a closed loan and in which the consumer, prior to the effective date of this Temporary Order, obtained funding through an alternate lender, First Magnus Financial shall reimburse each consumer the amount necessary to put the consumer in the same position as if First Magnus Financial had funded the mortgage loan under the terms and conditions agreed upon at the closing of the loan.

The record should include telephone numbers of contact persons at each lender who is familiar with the Corporation's submitted loans;  As soon as possible, but not later than five (5) days after the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, First Magnus Financial shall submit to the Commissioner all information on file as of the date of submission regarding the Corporation's pipeline of pending mortgage loan applications including but not limited to, the following: The names of all individuals from whom First Magnus Financial has accepted an application for a residential mortgage loan; the applicants' addresses and telephone numbers; the loan number; the amount of all prepaid loan fees submitted by the customer; rate lock status; the amount of each loan; application status (i.e. filed, submitted to lenders, cleared to close, etc.); loan terms, if approved; scheduled closing dates; the loan purpose (i.e. purchase or refinance); and identification of the applicable lender or broker with whom each application will be placed.

The balance sheet shall indicate First Magnus Financial's cash position at each of its depository banks as well as First Magnus Financial's bank account numbers.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that First Magnus Financial shall not pay or declare a dividend, nor otherwise authorize or execute any financial transaction, either singular or structured, in excess of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.00), except for wages and salaries paid to employees, contractors, officers, or other members of First Magnus Financial's management in the normal course of their business, without the prior written approval of the Commissioner. Upon the effective date of this Temporary Order, First Magnus Financial shall implement or revise its practices and procedures, as necessary, to ensure that their financial books and records are accurately maintained, in a manner illustrating compliance with the provisions of this Paragraph, and available for review by the Division's examiners upon request.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that First Magnus Financial shall immediately secure all pending mortgage loan application files and, to the extent that any original documents must be forwarded to the relevant mortgage lender(s) and or mortgage broker(s) pursuant to Paragraph 21 of this TEMPORARY ORDER, a copy of such document, correspondence, or paper relating to the mortgage loan shall be retained in First Magnus Financial's books and records and shall be available to the Commissioner, in their entirety, upon request.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE BROKER  LICENSING  Docket No. 2007-026  FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  METROPOLITAN CAPITAL CONSULTANTS, INC.  d/b/a METROPOLIS FUNDING  Babylon, New York  Mortgage Broker License No. MB2906  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that METROPOLITAN CAPITAL CONSULTANTS, INC., d/b/a METROPOLIS FUNDING (""Metropolitan Capital"" or the ""Corporation""), located at 63 West Main Street, Babylon, New York 11702 has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""Temporary Order"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  Metropolitan Capital is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage broker license to Metropolitan Capital to engage in the business of a mortgage broker in Massachusetts on or about December 6, 2002.  Metropolitan Capital is, and at all relevant times, has been a foreign corporation conducting business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Metropolitan Capital's main office is located at 63 West Main Street, Babylon, New York.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8 states, in part, that: 	 Each licensee shall, when directed by said commissioner, permit said commissioner or his duly authorized representative to inspect its relevant records and evidence of compliance with the provisions of this chapter or any rule or regulation issued hereunder and with any other law, rule or regulation applicable to the conduct of the business for which it is licensed under this chapter . . . . For the purposes of such inspection, said commissioner or his representative shall have access to the offices and place of business, books, accounts, papers, records and files of all such licensees.  The Division's regulation governing the maintenance of books and records, at 209 CMR 48.04 states, in part: 	 ""Each Licensee shall keep and use its books, records, and accounts within the Commonwealth, except, however, that with the prior approval by the Commissioner of a written plan, a Licensee may keep such books, records, and accounts at a location, or locations, outside of the Commonwealth. Such written plan shall contain:  	(1) an agreement to provide access, within 72 hours of an official request, to any requested books, records, and accounts to a suitable and mutually agreed upon location within the Commonwealth for the purpose of examination…""  Pursuant to the Division's regulation 209 CMR 48.04, the Commissioner approved Metropolitan Capital's out-of-state record keeping plan, allowing the Corporation to maintain its books and records at its main office in Babylon, New York.  The out-of-state record keeping plan referenced in Paragraph 6 of this Temporary Order provides that, in response to a request from the Division, Metropolitan Capital shall send requested books, records and accounts to the Division's offices in the Commonwealth for the Division's examination/inspection purposes.  On Monday, July 16, 2007, pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division requested access to Metropolitan Capital's books and records for the purpose of assessing the Corporation's level of compliance with applicable Massachusetts statutes and the Division's regulations governing the conduct of those engaged in the business of a mortgage broker in the Commonwealth.  On July 16, 2007, the Division's examiner e-mailed Metropolitan Capital a ""first-day letter"" to an e-mail address provided by the Corporation to the Division and maintained in the Division's records. In addition, the Division's examiner left a voicemail message on the Corporation's general voicemail to notify Metropolitan Capital that an examination had been scheduled and to alert the Corporation that the aforementioned e-mail had been sent. The ""first day letter"" required that the requested information be made available to the Division no later than two weeks from the date of the letter. The records requested included, but were not limited to: 	 Current balance sheet and income and expense statement for the interim period from the last fiscal year end through present;  Reconcilement(s) for all cash accounts, including the operating account;  Reconcilement(s) for all customer escrow accounts;  Aggregate dollar balance of all customer rate lock commitment fees and deferred origination fees held;  Most recent internal audit report;  Officer's questionnaire; and  Loan list for all activity as of the date of the last examination/inspection.  On, Thursday, July 19, 2007, the Division's examiner sent out a second e-mail reminding the Corporation that the information requested in Paragraph 9 of this Temporary Order would be due within two weeks.  As of Tuesday, July 24, 2007, the Corporation had failed to respond to the Division's requests for information. On July 24, 2007 the Division's examiner contacted Mr. Michael Gross, a representative of Metropolitan Capital via telephone to reiterate the Division's requests for records. Mr. Gross informed the Division's examiner that the Corporation did not usually check the e-mail account to which the original e-mail had been sent. As a result, the Division's examiner e-mailed the information requested in Paragraph 9 of this Temporary Order, including the ""first day letter,"" to Mr. Gross's personal e-mail and noted that the Corporation should forward a loan list ""as soon as possible,"" so that the examination could commence.  On Friday, July 27, 2007, the Division's examiner e-mailed Mr. Gross once again and requested the loan list, and reminded Mr. Gross that all information requested in Paragraph 9 of this Temporary Order would be due at the latest, on Monday, July 30, 2007.  On Friday, July 27, 2007, Mr. Gross replied to the Division's examiner's e-mail of July 27th and requested some additional time to submit all required information to the Division. Mr. Gross stated that he would have ""the loan list … returned by Monday [Monday July, 30, 2007] before noon.""  On Friday, July 27, 2007, the Division's examiner's contacted Mr. Gross via telephone and stated that if Mr. Gross submitted the files by Monday, July 30, 2007, that would be satisfactory.  On Tuesday, July 31, 2007, the Division's examiner e-mailed Mr. Gross to remind him that at the very least, the Division would need a loan list by the end of the day, and noted that the Division had received none of the information that Mr. Gross had stated he would forward to the Division as referenced in Paragraph 13 of this Temporary Order.  On Tuesday, July 31, 2007, in response to the e-mail sent by the Division's examiner, Mr. Gross forwarded a loan list with Massachusetts loans originated since the Corporation's most recent examination. The list did not contain all the information requested in the Division's July 27, 2007 e-mail. Specifically the loan list did not include loan numbers, commissions received, lender/investor information, identification of originators, application documentation program (stated, full, limited, etc.), application information, including receipt date, status, decision date, action taken, etc. Mr. Gross noted in his e-mail that he was ""working on a new report.""  On Tuesday, July 31, 2007, after reviewing the loan list provided by Mr. Gross, the Division requested approximately fifteen (15) loan files for review. Mr. Gross e-mailed the Division on Tuesday, July 31, 2007 indicating that the ""files [were to be copied] and sent via UPS ASAP.""  On Monday, August 6, 2007, the Division's examiner sent Mr. Gross an e-mail requesting the files that were to be sent pursuant to the Division's requests referenced in Paragraphs 9 and 14 of this Temporary Order.  On Tuesday, August 7, 2007, at approximately 7:28 p.m. EST, Mr. Gross e-mailed the Division's examiner and noted that he was ""making copies [of the files] as quickly as possible."" The e-mail further stated that Mr. Gross would ""make sure the files arrived [sic] by weeks end.""  On Thursday, August 23, 2007, as a result of the events referenced in Paragraphs 6 through 19 of this Temporary Order, the Division renewed its request via a letter sent by certified mail and facsimile to the Corporation's office of record. The request required Metropolitan Capital to submit the records by no later than 72 hours after receipt of the letter. The Division's letter also stated that failure to submit the requested documents presents sufficient grounds for the assessment of a penalty of $5,000 for each day that such records have not been provided after the expiration of the 72 hour period, up to a maximum of $100,000, pursuant to M.G.L. c. 255E, section 11. The USPS tracking records obtained by the Division indicate that the letter was delivered on August 29, 2007 at 12:23 p.m.  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 48.06(2) states, in part, that: 	 Failure of a Licensee to keep its books and records in accordance with 209 CMR 48.00  et seq . may result in suspension or revocation of the license under the authority contained in the specific statute applicable to the Licensee.  As of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, all of the documents requested by the Division, as referenced in Paragraphs 9 and 17 of this Order, have not been provided to the Division. 	 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 22, Metropolitan Capital has failed to demonstrate the character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 22, Metropolitan Capital repeatedly failed to provide the Division's representatives with access to Metropolitan Capital's books, accounts, records and files to permit an inspection of such records, in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 22, Metropolitan Capital repeatedly failed to provide the Division's representatives with access to Metropolitan Capital's books, accounts, records and files to permit an inspection in violation of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 48.04(1), which requires that such records be provided within 72 hours of an official request and in violation of Metropolitan Capital's out-of-state record keeping plan approved pursuant thereto.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 22, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 Metropolitan Capital has engaged in, is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that it is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage broker including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. ; and  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an Order to cease and desist to Metropolitan Capital.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 22, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of Metropolitan Capital's original mortgage broker license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in paragraphs 1 through 22 present sufficient grounds for the revocation of Metropolitan Capital's mortgage broker license pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.07(2)(b). 	 ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that Metropolitan Capital and any and all officers, directors, employees, independent contractors, or agents operating on behalf of Metropolitan Capital, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of a mortgage broker, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Temporary Order. Therefore, Metropolitan Capital is ordered to immediately cease soliciting or accepting, either directly or indirectly, any residential mortgage loan applications from consumers for residential property located in Massachusetts.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Metropolitan Capital, shall immediately place any fees previously collected from Massachusetts consumers relative to any pending mortgage loan applications in a separate escrow account maintained at a federally insured bank.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Metropolitan Capital shall immediately place with one or more qualified broker(s) or lender(s), as appropriate based on the status of the application and with no loss to applicants, all of its pending Massachusetts residential mortgage loan applications. Metropolitan Capital shall obtain the prior approval of the Commissioner before placing such applications to the qualified broker(s) or lender(s).  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Metropolitan Capital shall submit to the Commissioner a detailed record, prepared as of the date of submission, of all of the Corporation's pending residential mortgage loan applications on property located in Massachusetts. The records to be produced shall be submitted to the Commissioner within five (5) days of the effective date of this Temporary Order and shall include all information on file, regarding the Corporation's open application list, including but not necessarily limited to, the following: 	 All information on file as of the date of submission regarding Metropolitan Capital's open application list as a mortgage broker, including but not limited to, the following: The names of all individuals from whom Metropolitan Capital has accepted an application for a residential mortgage loan; the applicants' addresses and telephone numbers; the amount of all prepaid loan fees submitted by the customer; the amount of each loan; application status (i.e. filed, submitted to lenders, cleared to close, etc.); scheduled closing dates; rate lock status; and a list identifying the applicable broker or lender with whom the applicants' application was placed. The latter list should include telephone numbers of contact persons familiar with the Corporation's submitted loans.  Metropolitan Capital shall immediately secure all pending residential mortgage loan application files and, to the extent that any original documents must be forwarded to the relevant mortgage lender(s) and or mortgage broker(s) pursuant to Paragraph 30 of this Temporary Order, a copy of such document, correspondence, or paper relating to the mortgage loan shall be retained in Metropolitan Capital's books and records and shall be available to the Commissioner, in their entirety, upon request.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Temporary Order shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under General Laws chapter 30A.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such Temporary Order shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from Metropolitan Capital within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this Temporary Order.

The out-of-state record keeping plan referenced in Paragraph 6 of this Temporary Order provides that, in response to a request from the Division, Metropolitan Capital shall send requested books, records and accounts to the Division's offices in the Commonwealth for the Division's examination/inspection purposes.  On Monday, July 16, 2007, pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division requested access to Metropolitan Capital's books and records for the purpose of assessing the Corporation's level of compliance with applicable Massachusetts statutes and the Division's regulations governing the conduct of those engaged in the business of a mortgage broker in the Commonwealth.

48,10/25/2021,2007,Temporary Cease and Desist,"All States Mortgage Company, Inc.",Mortgage Broker,"failure to fund some mortgages, failure to timely disburse funds",Vienna VA,https://www.mass.gov/temporary-order-to-cease-and-desist/all-states-mortgage-company-inc," The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  All States Mortgage is, and at all relevant times has been, a corporation conducting business in the Commonwealth. All States Mortgage's main office is located at 581 Boylston Street, Suite 302, Boston, Massachusetts.  All States Mortgage is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner issued mortgage broker license number MB2467 to All States Mortgage to engage in the business of a mortgage broker at 581 Boylston Street, Boston, Massachusetts on or about November 13, 2001.  Nuhu G. Mohammed is the President, director, and sole shareholder of All States Mortgage. 	 (i) Felony Indictments/Convictions Affecting a Determination of the Licensee's Financial Responsibility, Character, Reputation, Integrity and General Fitness to Engage in the Licensed Business  On March 3, 2006, the United States Attorney's Office filed a sealed complaint against Mr. Mohammed in the United States District Court, District of Massachusetts. Magistrate Judge Joyce London Alexander issued an arrest warrant against Mr. Mohammed on the same date.  On March 8, 2006, Mr. Mohammed was arrested pursuant to the warrant issued on March 3, 2006.  On March 28, 2006, a federal Grand Jury, impaneled in the United States District Court, District of Massachusetts, returned an indictment against Mr. Mohammed charging him with one count of False Statement in Application for a United States Passport in violation of Title 18 United States Code, Section 1542 and two counts of Identity Theft in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1028 (collectively, the ""Charges""). 	 Count one of the indictment alleged that on or around May 5, 2004, Mr. Mohammed ""did willfully and knowingly make a false statement in an application for passport, [by] falsely representing himself to be Miguel Fernandez, a United States citizen, with intent to induce and secure the issuance of a passport under the authority of the United States….,"" in violation of Title 18 United States Code, Section 1542;  Count two of the indictment alleged that, on or around May 5, 2004, Mr. Mohammed ""did knowingly possess an identification document (other than one issued lawfully for the use of the possessor) and a false identification document, to wit: a Puerto Rico birth certificate in the name of Miguel Fernandez, with the intent such document be used to defraud the United States,"" in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1028; and  Count three of the indictment alleged that, on or around May 5, 2004, Mr. Mohammed ""did knowingly possess an identification document (other than one issued lawfully for the use of the possessor) and a false identification document, to wit: a Massachusetts Identification Card in the name of Miguel Fernandez, with the intent such document or feature be used to defraud the United States…,"" in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1028.  On April 13, 2007, Mr. Mohammed entered a guilty plea as to all three felony counts referenced in Paragraph 7 of this Order. On August 23, 2007, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered judgment against Mr. Mohammed on each count, sentencing him to probation for a term of thirty-six (36) months with criminal monetary penalties totaling five thousand, three hundred dollars ($5,300.00). The sentence was within the advisory guideline range and the court found no reason to depart from such guidelines.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 states, in part, that: 	 Upon the filing of an application for a license, if the commissioner finds that the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity and general fitness of the applicant, and of the partners or members thereof if the applicant is a partnership or association, and of the officers, directors and principal employees if the applicant is a corporation, are such as to warrant belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest consistent with the purposes of this chapter, he shall thereupon issue the applicant a license to engage in the business of a mortgage lender or mortgage broker. If the commissioner shall not so find, he shall not issue a license and he shall notify the applicant of the denial.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 states, in part, that: 	 The commissioner may suspend or revoke any license issued pursuant to this chapter if said commissioner finds that: (i) the licensee has violated any provision of this chapter or any rule or regulation adopted hereunder, or any other law applicable to the conduct of its business; or (ii) any fact or condition exists which, if it had existed at the time of the original application for such license, would have warranted the commissioner in refusing to issue such license.  (ii)Failure to Notify the Division of the Occurrence of Significant Developments  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.12(2) states, in part, that: 	 A Licensee shall notify the Commissioner immediately, and in writing within five business days, of the occurrence of any of the following significant developments: . . . (b) Criminal felony indictment or conviction of any of the Licensee's officers, directors, principal stockholders, or affiliates.  All States Mortgage failed to notify the Commissioner, as required by 209 CMR 42.12(2)(b), of both the felony indictment of Mr. Mohammed and of his subsequent conviction on such Charges.  On May 2, 2007, the Division received All States Mortgage's 2007 Mortgage Broker License Renewal Application (""License Renewal Application""), and a Criminal Offender Record Information Request Form signed by and for Mr. Mohammed, authorizing the Division to access Mr. Mohammed's criminal offender record information (""CORI""), in accordance with the Division's licensing requirements. Through the License Renewal Application, All States Mortgage sought the renewal of its Massachusetts mortgage broker license for the twelve-month period ending May 31, 2008.  The License Renewal Application, which was signed under the pains and penalties of perjury by Mr. Mohammed on May 1, 2007, included the following question, numbered (4)(A): ""In the past twelve months, has the licensee, or any control affiliate or control person: (1) been convicted of or plead guilty or nolo contendere (""no contest"") in a domestic, foreign, or military court to any felony? (2) been charged with any felony."" The answer to the question provided by Mr. Mohammed was ""No.""  The License Renewal Application Form instructions expressly define a 'control person' as a natural person that exercises, ""The power, directly or indirectly, to direct the management or policies of a company, whether through ownership of securities, by contract, or otherwise. Any  person  that (i) is a director, general partner or executive officer; (ii) directly or indirectly has the right to vote 10% or more of a class of a voting security or has the power to sell or direct the sale of 10% or more of a class of voting securities;…""  Mr. Mohammed submitted the License Renewal Application to the Division less than three weeks after he had entered his guilty plea on the three felony counts in the U.S. District Court.  On May 8, 2007, the Division received Mr. Mohammed's CORI results from the Criminal History Systems Board (""CHSB""). The Division determined that the application question referenced in Paragraph 14 of this Order appeared to have been answered inaccurately as the CORI report indicated that Mr. Mohammed had been charged with three felonies which appeared to remain pending as of the preparation date of the CORI report.  On July 3, 2007, the Division mailed Mr. Mohammed a letter requesting an explanation of the information revealed on the CORI report and advising him of his rights under the CHSB regulations, including the opportunity to challenge the accuracy or relevance of the information revealed on the CORI report.  In response to the Division's July 3, 2007 inquiry, Mr. Mohammed submitted a written statement dated July 13, 2007. Mr. Mohammed stated that he ""mistakenly assumed that the questions pertained to the corporation, All State[s] [Mortgage], and not [himself], as an individual."" He also noted that he pled guilty to the charges on the advice of his counsel but that he ""personally disputed the charges.""  By signing the License Renewal Application, Mr. Mohammed represented and agreed to, ""keep the information contained in this form current and to file accurate supplementary information on a timely basis.""  Although specifically addressed by Question (4)(A) of the License Renewal Application, Mr. Mohammed again failed to notify the Division of the entering of the indictments referenced in Paragraph 7 of this Order, and of his entering of a guilty plea on such Charges. In fact, Mr. Mohammed did not disclose the occurrence of his felony indictments and guilty plea until the Division requested additional information from him after reviewing his CORI report during the processing of All State Mortgage's License Renewal Application. 	 (iii) Material Misrepresentations to the Division  Mortgage brokers in Massachusetts are licensed and regulated under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, which is administered and enforced by the Commissioner. Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division is authorized to inspect the books, accounts, papers, records, and files of mortgage brokers transacting business in Massachusetts to determine compliance with the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E and any rule, or regulation issued thereunder, and with any laws, rules, regulations, and regulatory bulletins applicable to the conduct of the business of a mortgage broker.  On July 14, 2006, pursuant to the authority granted under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division commenced an examination/inspection of the books, accounts, papers, records, and files maintained by All States Mortgage to evaluate the Corporation's compliance with the laws, rules, regulations, and regulatory bulletins applicable to the conduct of a mortgage broker business in Massachusetts (the ""2006 examination/inspection"").  The Report of Examination/Inspection issued pursuant to the 2006 examination/inspection (""Report"") alleged that All States Mortgage failed to comply with certain applicable state and federal statutes, rules, and regulations governing the conduct of those engaged in the business of a mortgage broker in Massachusetts. The Report, and all of the correspondence exchanged between All States Mortgage and the Division in response to the Report, is incorporated herein by reference.  By letter dated February 20, 2007, sent via certified mail, the Division notified All States Mortgage that, as a result of the numerous compliance violations cited in the Report, the Division would be requiring an informal enforcement action in the form of a Memorandum of Understanding (""Memorandum"").  The February 20, 2007 mailing referenced in Paragraph 25 of this Order included a copy of the Report as well as the Memorandum, and notified All States Mortgage that a detailed written response to each of the matters addressed in the Report and a copy of the signed Memorandum would be due within thirty (30) days of receipt of all documents. The Report and Memorandum were delivered to All States Mortgage's business office in Boston, Massachusetts on February 23, 2007.  On or around June 14, 2007, via a letter mailed by First Class Mail, the Division notified All States Mortgage that the Division had not received a response to the Report from All States Mortgage and advised the Corporation that the response to the Report, and the signed Memorandum, would be due within two weeks.  On June 18, 2007, the Division received the All States Mortgage's response to the Report as well as the Memorandum executed by Mr. Mohammed as of June 15, 2007. The Memorandum is incorporated herein by reference.  The findings of the Report and Section III of the Memorandum required that All States Mortgage reimburse the consumers identified in the Report for the amounts collected as a broker fee, loan fee, points or similar fee at settlement that had not been disclosed to the consumers, in writing, prior to loan closing. The Corporation was required to submit evidence of such reimbursements with its written response to the Report.  After reviewing the documents referenced in Paragraph 28 of this Order, the Division notified All States Mortgage by letter dated July 25, 2007 that the response to the Report was unsatisfactory. Among other deficiencies, All States Mortgage failed to submit evidence of the reimbursements paid to borrowers identified in the Report, as required pursuant to the Memorandum.  On August 8, 2007, the Division received All States Mortgage's response to the July 25, 2007 letter. In its response to the Division, the Corporation stated, ""I am enclosing correspondence addressing the violations and issues to be resolved . . . . I am providing you evidence of the refunds paid to the seven borrowers identified in the Report for undisclosed fee violations."" However, the Corporation failed to include such evidence of the reimbursements.  By letter dated September 17, 2007, the Division again notified All States Mortgage of deficiencies in the Corporation's response, including but not limited to, failure to provide evidence of the reimbursements required pursuant to Section III of the Memorandum. The Division required a response from All States Mortgage within twenty days of receipt of the letter.  On September 20, 2007, All States Mortgage contacted the Division to request additional time in which to respond to the Division's September 17, 2007 letter. The Division verbally agreed to extend the deadline until October 15, 2007.  On October 23, 2007, the Division received All States Mortgage's response to the Division's correspondence of September 17, 2007. Included in the Corporation's response were copies of checks evidencing reimbursements to the borrowers that were required pursuant to Section III of the Memorandum. Each of the checks enclosed in the Corporation's response was dated October 15, 2007, despite All States Mortgage's previous representations to the Division that the reimbursements had been made on or around August 8, 2007.

MB2239  et al.  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that LUCNER CHARLES d/b/a MASS FINANCIAL MORTGAGE COMPANY (""Lucner Charles"" or Mass Financial Mortgage""), located at 1601 Blue Hill Avenue, Mattapan, Massachusetts 02126 has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST & ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE AND NOTICE OF RIGHT TO A HEARING (collectively referred to as the ""ORDER"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E sections 6 and 7(b).  I. FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  A. REGULATORY BACKGROUND AND FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  Lucner Charles is, and at all relevant times has been, an individual engaged in the business of a mortgage broker in the Commonwealth with an office located at 1601 Blue Hill Avenue, Mattapan, Massachusetts.  Lucner Charles is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage broker license number MB2239 to Lucner Charles to engage in the business of a mortgage broker at 1601 Blue Hill Avenue, Mattapan, Massachusetts on April 18, 2001.  Lucner Charles maintains an additional license for an office location at 100 Main Street, Brockton, Massachusetts. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner issued a mortgage broker license, license number MB3309, to Lucner Charles for that location on February 13, 2004.  Mortgage brokers in Massachusetts are licensed and regulated under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, which is administered and enforced by the Commissioner. Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division is authorized to inspect the books, accounts, papers, records, and files of mortgage brokers transacting business in Massachusetts to determine compliance with the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E or any rule, or regulation issued thereunder, and with any laws, rules, regulations, and regulatory bulletins applicable to the conduct of the business of a mortgage broker. 	 The 2004 Examination/Inspection  On January 30, 2004, the Division commenced an examination/inspection of the books, accounts, papers, records, and files maintained by Lucner Charles to evaluate Mass Financial Mortgage Company's compliance with the laws, regulations, and regulatory bulletins applicable to the conduct of a mortgage broker business in Massachusetts (the ""2004 examination/inspection"").  On or about October 28, 2005, based upon information obtained by the Division during the examination/inspection and information submitted by Lucner Charles in response to the 2004 Report, the Division issued an ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE AND NOTICE OF RIGHT TO A HEARING (""ORDER AND NOTICE""), Docket No. 2005-023, against Lucner Charles. The ORDER AND NOTICE set forth the deficiencies, unsatisfactory conditions, and violations of applicable laws and regulations alleged in the Report and in the materials submitted by Lucner Charles in response to the findings of the Report.  On December 9, 2005, Lucner Charles filed an Answer to the ORDER AND NOTICE with the Division whereby Lucner Charles contested the Division's findings and the alleged violations of law contained in the ORDER AND NOTICE.  On March 30, 2007, for the purpose of settlement, the Commissioner and Lucner Charles entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (""Memorandum"") to address the matters raised by the findings in the 2004 report. The Memorandum is incorporated herein by reference. 	 The 2007 Examination/Inspection  On October 15, 2007, pursuant to the authority granted under Massachusetts 	 General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division commenced an examination/inspection (the ""2007 examination/inspection"") of the books, accounts, papers, records, and files maintained by Lucner Charles to evaluate his compliance with: (1) the laws, regulations, and regulatory bulletins applicable to the conduct of the mortgage broker business in Massachusetts and (2) the provisions of the Memorandum.  The Division requested that Lucner Charles provide for inspection every loan file maintained for mortgage loans originated during the period of March 1, 2003 through October 15, 2007. In response to the request, Lucner Charles provided four consumer loan files for mortgage loans which were originated during 2006.  Lucner Charles identified the four consumer loan files as the only complete closed files retained by Mass Financial Mortgage.  The Division's Report of Examination/Inspection (the ""Report""), which was issued to Lucner Charles on the effective date of this ORDER, presented the findings of the 2007 examination/inspection and alleged significant failures to comply with (1) applicable state and federal laws, rules, regulations, and regulatory bulletins governing the conduct of those engaged in the business of a mortgage broker in Massachusetts and (2) the provisions of the Memorandum. 	 (i) Substantial Non-Compliance with the Terms of a Memorandum of Understanding  Section IX of the Memorandum states: 	 Failure to comply with the provisions of this MEMORANDUM, as determined by the Commissioner, shall constitute grounds for license revocation or other regulatory action under General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 and the Division's regulation, 209 CMR 42.00,  et seq.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2007 examination/inspection indicate that Lucner Charles engaged in the following acts or practices that were in violation of the Memorandum. 	 (a) Failure to Properly Disclose Points and Fees  Section I of the Memorandum states: 	 Lucner Charles shall immediately establish, implement, and maintain procedures to ensure that all broker fees, loan fees, points, or similar fees collected by the Company as compensation for administrative costs incurred in originating the mortgage loan are not charged to consumers except to the extent that such fees or points have been properly disclosed to the consumers by Mass Financial Mortgage, in writing, prior to the closing of the mortgage loan in accordance with Massachusetts General Laws chapter 183, section 63. While this MEMORANDUM is in effect, compliance with this Section shall require that all broker fees, loan fees, points, or similar fees collected by the Company as compensation for administrative costs incurred in originating the mortgage loan be disclosed to the consumer, in writing, at least seventy two (72) hours prior to the closing of the mortgage loan.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 183, section 63 states, in part: 	 A mortgagee, or a mortgage lender or mortgage broker as defined in section one of chapter two hundred and fifty-five E, shall not charge a loan fee, finder's fee, points, so-called, or similar fees in a mortgage transaction involving residential property located in the commonwealth of four or less units and occupied in whole or in part by the mortgagor, except to the extent that such fees or points have been previously disclosed to the mortgagor in writing. . . A mortgagor shall not be obligated to pay fees or points which have not been previously disclosed as required herein.  Lucner Charles' books and records reviewed during the 2007 examination/inspection indicate that processing fees, application fees, and origination fees (collectively, ""broker fees"") were collected from borrowers at the loan closing, as identified in the Report, in amounts which were not accurately disclosed to the borrowers, in writing, to the extent charged at closing, if at all.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2007 examination/inspection illustrate that Lucner Charles failed to implement adequate procedures, as required by the Memorandum, that would ensure that all broker fees, loan fees, points, or similar fees collected as compensation for administrative costs incurred in originating the mortgage loan were not charged to consumers except to the extent that such fees or points had been properly disclosed to the consumers, in writing, prior to the closing of the mortgage loan. 	 (b) Frustrating the Division's Efforts to Conduct the Mandated Examination/Inspection  Section II of the Memorandum states, in part: 	 In not less than thirty (30) days and not more than one hundred eighty (180) days from the effective date of this MEMORANDUM, the Division shall conduct an examination/inspection of Mass Financial Mortgage, at Mass Financial Mortgage's expense, which shall include, but not be limited to, a review of all Massachusetts residential mortgage loans originated by Mass Financial Mortgage since March 1, 2003 in order to identify any mortgage loan transactions in which the amount paid by the consumer as an origination fee, mortgage broker fee, or similar fee, as recorded on the settlement agreement, exceeded the amount disclosed to the consumer, in writing, for such fees prior to the date on which the loan closing occurred. It being understood that any violations of General Laws chapter 183, section 63 relative to the charging of points and fees may require Lucner Charles to reimburse consumers for any undisclosed, or underdisclosed, points and fees charged by Lucner Charles.  At the commencement of the 2007 examination/inspection, the Division's examiners requested that every loan file as of March 1, 2003 be made available for inspection in accordance with Section II of the Memorandum.  In response to the Division's request for loan files, Lucner Charles informed the Division's examiner that he had destroyed all consumer loan files which he had originated during the entire period of March 1, 2003 through December 31, 2005.  In response to the Division's request for loan files, Lucner Charles produced only four of the sixteen loan files reported in his annual report, referenced below in subpart (c), to the Division as having been originated in 2006. Moreover, such files did not contain all papers or records relating to the loans, as further described in Section (I)(A)(i)(d) of this Order.  By failing to properly retain his books and records as required, Lucner Charles prevented the Division from conducting a complete review of Mass Financial Mortgage's loan files since March 1, 2003, as agreed upon pursuant to the terms of Section II of the Memorandum. Therefore, the Division was unable to identify any mortgage loan transactions in which the amount paid by the consumer as an origination fee, mortgage broker fee, or similar fee, as recorded on the settlement agreement, exceeded the amount disclosed to the consumer, in writing, for such fees prior to the date on which the loan closing occurred. By destroying records, which prevented the Division from identifying any instances of undisclosed or underdisclosed fees, Lucner Charles frustrated the Division's attempts to ensure that consumer(s) are properly reimbursed for the difference between the actual charge assessed to the consumer(s) as a loan fee, mortgage broker fee, processing fee, or similar fee and the amount disclosed in writing for such fees prior to closing. 	 (c) Failure to Submit Required Reports  Section III(b) of the Memorandum states, in part: 	 On the thirtieth (30  th ) day after the end of each calendar quarter following the date of this MEMORANDUM, beginning with the calendar quarter ending March 31, 2007, Mass Financial Mortgage shall submit to the Commissioner quarterly financial statements, prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, for such calendar quarter.  The Division's records indicate that Lucner Charles failed to submit the required quarterly financial statements for the calendar quarter ended June 30, 2007.  Section III(c) of the Memorandum states: 	 Nothing contained in this Section of this MEMORANDUM is intended to modify, limit, or otherwise release the duties and obligations imposed upon Mass Financial Mortgage to file with the Commissioner, on or before April 15  th  of each calendar year, any reports required under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8 states, in part: 	 Each licensee shall annually, on or before the fifteenth day of April, file a report with the commissioner containing such information as said commissioner may require concerning the business and operations during the preceding calendar year at each licensed place of business conducted by a licensee in the commonwealth.  The Division's records indicate that Lucner Charles submitted his annual report on May 8, 2007, after the filing deadline specified in M.G.L. c. 255E, section 8 and the Memorandum.  Section XI of the Memorandum states, 	 On the thirtieth (30  th ) day after the end of each calendar quarter following the date of this MEMORANDUM, beginning with the calendar quarter ended March 31, 2007, Mass Financial Mortgage shall furnish written progress reports to the Division, detailing the form, content and manner of any actions taken to address each Section of this MEMORANDUM, and shall describe, in detail, any other consumer compliance initiatives instituted during the calendar quarter to improve the compliance position of Mass Financial Mortgage, and the results thereof. Each progress report submitted to the Division pursuant to this Section of the MEMORANDUM shall be reviewed and signed by a duly authorized senior officer of Mass Financial Mortgage.  The Division's records indicate that Lucner Charles also failed to submit a progress report for the quarter ended June 30, 2007. 	 (d) Failure to Properly Maintain and Provide Access to Books and Records  Section IV of the Memorandum states, in part: 	 Within thirty (30) days from the effective date of this MEMORANDUM, Mass Financial Mortgage shall establish, implement, and maintain written policies and procedures to ensure that Mass Financial Mortgage maintains all books, records, and accounts in accordance with the requirements of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.09. The policies and procedures are to include but are not limited to:  (b) Implementing procedures to ensure the full cooperation of all Mass Financial Mortgage employees with the Division during all future examinations of Mass Financial Mortgage which shall necessarily provide for complete and timely access to its books, records, accounts, and any other additional, relevant materials pursuant to the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.09(1)(b) states: 	 Each Licensee shall keep and use its books, records and accounts in a manner which will allow the Commissioner to determine whether the Licensee is complying with the provisions of M.G.L. c. 255E and applicable state and federal laws and regulations. Each Licensee shall comply with the provisions of 209 CMR 48.00.  (b) The mortgage broker shall retain for a minimum of three years after a mortgage loan is made the following: the original loan origination and compensation agreement as set out in 209 CMR 42.16; a copy of the settlement statement; an account of fees received in connection with the loan; correspondence; papers or records relating to the loan; and such other documents as the Commissioner may require.  At the commencement of the 2007 examination/inspection, the Division's examiners requested that every loan file as of March 1, 2003 be made available for inspection in accordance with Section II of the Memorandum which states, ""[T]he Division shall conduct an examination/inspection of Mass Financial Mortgage . . . which shall include, but not be limited to, a review of all Massachusetts residential mortgage loans originated by Mass Financial Mortgage since March 1, 2003.""  As set forth above, Lucner Charles informed the Division's examiner that he had destroyed all consumer loan files which he had originated during the entire period of March 1, 2003 through December 31, 2005.  As referenced above, Lucner Charles identified the four consumer loan files which were provided during the 2007 examination/inspection as the only complete closed files that he had retained.  The loan files submitted by Lucner Charles, in addition to missing twelve previously reported originated loans, did not contain all papers or records relating to the loans, as required under 209 CMR 42.09(1)(b). Specifically, Lucner Charles failed to retain completed loan applications in any of the four available loan files. In addition, one loan file did not contain a copy of the final HUD-1 settlement statement, as specifically identified in the Report.  As further described in Section (I)(A)(i)(d) of this Order, Lucner Charles' failure to properly maintain and provide access to books and records prevented the Division from conducting a complete review of the Licensee's loan files since March 1, 2003, as agreed upon pursuant to Section II of the Memorandum. 	 (e) Conducting Mortgage Broker Business Using an Unauthorized Name  Section V of the Memorandum states, in part: 	 Mass Financial Mortgage, when performing in the capacity of a mortgage broker in Massachusetts, shall at all times conduct business exclusively under the business name stated on its mortgage broker license as issued by the Commissioner.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 5 states, in part: 	 [A]ny such business shall at all times be conducted in the name of the licensee as it appears on the license.  Lucner Charles is currently licensed to conduct his mortgage broker business in Massachusetts as ""Lucner Charles d/b/a Mass Financial Mortgage Company."" However, documents contained in the four loan files reviewed during the 2007 examination/inspection revealed that Lucner Charles identified himself as ""Mass Financial Mortgage Corp."" 	 (f) Failure to Properly Complete Good Faith Estimates  Section VI of the Memorandum states: 	 Mass Financial Mortgage shall revise its procedures to ensure that all Good Faith Estimates provided to consumers are completed in accordance with, and within the time period specified, by the provisions of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, 24 CFR Part 3500.7.  The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (""RESPA"") regulation 24 CFR 3500.7(b) states, in part: 	 In the event an application is received by a mortgage broker who is not an exclusive agent of the lender, the mortgage broker must provide a good faith estimate within three days of receiving a loan application based on his or her knowledge of the range of costs.  Books and records reviewed during the 2007 examination/inspection revealed that Lucner Charles failed to provide good faith estimates within the mandated timing requirement in two of the loan files reviewed, as specifically identified in the Report.  The RESPA regulation 24 CMR 3500.7, Appendix C, footnote 1 states, in part: 	 If the disclosure is being made by a mortgage broker who is not an exclusive agent of the lender, the lender's name will not appear at the top of the form, but the following legend must appear:  This Good Faith Estimate is being provided by ________, a mortgage broker, and no lender has yet been obtained.  Books and records reviewed during the 2007 examination/inspection revealed that the good faith estimates provided by Lucner Charles failed to include the ""broker legend,"" as required.  The RESPA regulation 24 CMR 3500.7, Appendix B section 13 states, in part: 	 Any . . .fee or payment received by the mortgage broker from either the lender or the borrower arising from the initial funding transaction, including a servicing release premium or yield spread premium, is to be noted on the Good Faith Estimate and listed in the 800 series of the Settlement Statement.  Books and records reviewed during the 2007 examination/inspection revealed that, in one of the loan files reviewed, Lucner Charles failed to disclose the yield spread premium paid at closing on the good faith estimate provided to the borrower(s), as specifically identified in the Report. 	 (g) Failure to Remit Full Payment of Administrative Penalty  Section IX of the Memorandum states, in part: 	 In consideration of the activities identified by the Division and detailed in the Report, Mass Financial Mortgage agrees to the following:  (a) Mass Financial Mortgage agrees to submit a payment in the amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) in satisfaction of an administrative penalty. The administrative penalty shall be satisfied as follows:  Three thousand, four hundred dollars ($3,400.00) shall be due and payable upon the execution of this MEMORANDUM;  Three thousand, three hundred dollars ($3,300.00) shall be due and payable within ninety (90) days of the effective date of this MEMORANDUM; and  Three thousand, three hundred dollars ($3,300.00) shall be due and payable within one hundred and fifty (150) days of the effective date of this MEMORANDUM.  To date, Lucner Charles has failed to submit the installment payments described in Section IX(a)(ii) and Section IX(a)(iii) of the Memorandum. During the 2007 examination/inspection Lucner Charles confirmed that he had failed to remit such payments, which amount to nine thousand six hundred dollars ($9,600.00) in total. 	 (h) Failure to Implement and Maintain Required Revised Procedures  Section X(c) of the Memorandum states: 	 Lucner Charles shall establish, implement, and maintain internal controls and loan review procedures to monitor Mass Financial Mortgage's compliance with (i) the revised policies and procedures implemented pursuant to the provisions of this MEMORANDUM and (ii) the relevant statutes, rules and regulations applicable to licensed mortgage brokers in Massachusetts. Such procedures and policies shall be designed to: (i) prevent the recurrence of the violations addressed in the Report and (ii) ensure that Lucner Charles books, records, and accounts relating to the mortgage broker business are maintained in accordance with the record keeping requirements of 209 CMR 42.09 and 209 CMR 48.00 et seq. and available for the Division's inspection  As set forth herein in Paragraphs 6 through 50, Lucner Charles failed to adequately correct the violations identified in the 2004 examination/inspection, failed to adequately implement and maintain revised policies and procedures, and failed to adequately monitor Mass Financial Mortgage's activities to prevent the recurrence of the previous violations. 	 (ii.) Additional Compliance Violations  (a) Failure to Disclose Criminal Charges in a License Renewal Application  On April 13, 2007 the Division received Lucner Charles' 2007 Mortgage Broker License Renewal Application (""License Renewal Application""), and a signed Criminal Offender Record Information Request Form signed by and for Mr. Charles, authorizing the Division to access his criminal record information (""CORI""), as required pursuant to the Division's licensing requirements.  Question 4(B) of the License Renewal Application, signed under the pains and penalties of perjury by Mr. Charles, asked the following question: ""In the past twelve months, has the licensee, or any control affiliate or control person: (1) been convicted of or plead guilty or nolo contender (""no contest"") in a domestic, foreign, or military court to a misdemeanor involving: financial services or a financial services-related business; any fraud, false statements, or omissions; any theft or wrongful taking of property; bribery; perjury; forgery; counterfeiting; extortion; or a conspiracy to commit an of these offenses? (2) been charged with a misdemeanor specified in 4(B)(1)?"" The answer to the question provided by Lucner Charles was ""No.""  The Division received the CORI results from the Criminal History Systems Board (""CHSB""), and it was determined that the question referenced in Paragraph 54 of this Order may not have been answered truthfully, as the CORI indicated that Mr. Charles had been charged with four counts of Larceny by Check. The CORI indicated that Mr. Charles was arraigned for such charges on October 27, 2006 and the charges appeared to be pending as of the date the CORI was generated.  On September 7, 2007, the Division mailed Mr. Charles a letter requesting more information regarding the information revealed on the CORI and advising him of his rights under the CHSB's regulations, including the opportunity to challenge the accuracy or relevance of the information revealed in the CORI. The Division requested that Mr. Charles respond to the letter within ten days and noted that failure to timely respond may result in an adverse decision on Lucner Charles' Renewal Application.  On September 24, 2007, after discussions with Mr. Charles' counsel, the Division mailed Mr. Charles a letter extending the deadline in which to file a written response to the Division's September 7, 2007 letter until October 17, 2007.  To date, the Division has not received the information requested in Paragraph 56 of this ORDER. 	 (b) Deceptive Practices  During the 2007 examination/inspection, the Division's examiners discovered that financial statements purportedly compiled by a certified public accountant and submitted by Lucner Charles during the 2007 annual license renewal process, in conjunction with Lucner Charles' year-end 2006 annual report to the Division, contained identical asset and income figures as those financial statements compiled by the same certified public accountant and reported in Lucner Charles' year-end 2005 annual report.  Upon closer inspection of the aforementioned financial statements, the examiners determined that the year listed on the ""2006"" financial statements appeared to have been altered. Specifically, the number ""6"" appears in a different size and font and the document shows evidence of deliberate manipulation. Such evidence suggests that Lucner Charles submitted the 2005 financial statements during the 2007 license renewal process and altered the ""2005"" on the document to appear as ""2006.""  During the 2007 examination/inspection, Lucner Charles provided an unaudited balance sheet and income statement as of October 1, 2007, and the year ended December 31, 2006, as prepared by Lucner Charles' business consultant.  The financial statements referenced in Paragraph 61 included information that indicates that Mass Financial Mortgage's net income had decreased from $122,899 as reported in the Lucner Charles' year-end 2005 financial statements, to $21,398, from gross revenues of $42,358, down from $592,770 in 2005.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 59 through 62, it appears that Lucner Charles may have submitted false financial statements during the 2007 annual license renewal process relative to Lucner Charles' year-end 2006 annual report. 	 (c) Misleading Representations  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1) states, in part: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to make any representation or statement of fact if the representation or statement is false or misleading, or has the tendency or capacity to be misleading.  Books and records reviewed during the 2007 examination revealed that Lucner Charles provided applicants with a Borrower's Certification and Authorization Form that contained language that was false or misleading or had the tendency or capacity to be false or misleading. Specifically, the Borrower's Certification and Authorization Form contained language which would present the appearance that Lucner Charles, a mortgage broker, was approving or funding a loan.  The Division's examiners found that Lucner Charles use of misleading language in the Borrower's Certification and Authorization Form had been identified by the Division of Banks during a previous examination of Lucner Charles and was intended to be addressed and corrected by the terms of the Memorandum. 	 (d) Failure to Properly Complete and Timely Provide the Attorney General's Mortgage Broker Disclosure Form  The Attorney General's Regulation 940 CMR 8.05(1) states, in part: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker to fail to provide the . . . Attorney General's Mortgage Broker Disclosure Form (the ""Form""). This Form shall be completed with as much information as is available at the time the Form must be provided pursuant to 940 CMR 8.05(5).  Books and records reviewed during the 2007 examination/inspection revealed that, in all loan files reviewed, Lucner Charles failed to complete the Form with all available information.  The Division's examiners found that Lucner Charles' failure to properly complete the Form had been identified by the Division of Banks during a previous examination of Lucner Charles and was intended to be addressed and corrected by the terms of the Memorandum.  The Attorney General's Regulation 940 CMR 8.05(5) states, in part: 	 It is an unfair of deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker to fail to provide or mail to the borrower legible copies of the . . .disclosures described in 940 CMR 8.05(1) . . ., no later than three business days after the earliest of the following events:  the acceptance by the broker of an oral or written application for a mortgage loan;  any communication which leads the broker to incur any expenses on behalf of the borrower; or  entering into any oral or written agreement by the mortgage broker and the borrower.  Books and records reviewed during the 2007 examination/inspection revealed that, in two of the loan files reviewed, Lucner Charles failed to provide the Form within the mandated timing requirement, as specifically described in the Report. 	 (e) Failure to Retain the Loan Origination and Compensation Agreement  The Division's Regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(5) states: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice of a mortgage broker to fail to provide to the consumer at the time of application the loan origination and compensation agreement required under 209 CMR 42.16. The content of the agreement shall strictly conform to 209 CMR 42.16 and include signatures and dates by the consumer(s) and the mortgage broker.  The Division's Regulation 209 CMR 42.09(1)(b) states, in part: 	 Each mortgage broker . . . shall retain for a minimum of three years after a mortgage loan is made the following: the original loan origination and compensation agreement as set out in 209 CMR 42.16.  Books and records reviewed during the 2007 examination/inspection revealed that Lucner Charles failed to retain evidence of having provided the Loan Origination and Compensation Agreement (""LOCA"").  Because Lucner Charles failed to retain evidence of having provided the LOCA, the Division's examiners were unable to determine if Lucner Charles had provided the LOCA in accordance with the provisions of 209 CMR 42.12A(5). 	 (f) Failure to Notify the Division of the Closing and Relocation of Licensed Office Locations  The Division's Regulation 209 CMR 42.13(2) states: 	 Licensees shall provide thirty days prior written notice of any change or closing of a Massachusetts location to the Commissioner and shall contain such other information as the Commissioner may require.  During the 2007 examination/inspection the Division's examiners discovered that Lucner Charles' operations at Mass Financial Mortgage's Brockton office location had ceased as of 2003. Lucner Charles failed to provide the required written notice to the Division that the location had ceased operations.  During the 2007 examination/inspection, the Division's examiners discovered that Lucner Charles' main office location in Mattapan had been closed as of ""mid-2006."" Lucner Charles failed to provide the required written notice to the Division that such location has ceased operations. 	 B.

aphs 1 through 78, Lucner Charles has failed to demonstrate the character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).  By charging loan fees, points, or similar fees in mortgage transactions involving residential property located in the Commonwealth, of four or less units and occupied in whole or in part by the mortgagor, without disclosing such fees or points to the mortgagor prior to the closing of the loan, Lucner Charles has violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 183, section 63 and the Memorandum.  By destroying all books and records associated with mortgage loans originated between March 1, 2003 and December 31,2005, Lucner Charles prevented the Division from conducting a review of a mortgage loan portfolio which had exhibited a pattern or practice of reimbursable violations during a prior examination/inspection. Under these circumstances, the destruction of his books and records was in violation of: the Division's regulations 209 CMR 48.03 and 209 CMR 42.09(1); Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c); and the Memorandum.  By falsely representing to the Division, through the license renewal application, that he had not been charged with a misdemeanor specified therein in Question 4(B)(1) during the relevant time, Lucner Charles has failed to demonstrate the character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).  By altering financial statements submitted to the Division with his 2006 annual report, Lucner Charles has failed to demonstrate the character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 78, by conducting business using a name other than that which is stated on his mortgage broker license, Lucner Charles has violated Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 255E, section 5.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 78, by failing to properly complete the Good Faith Estimate disclosure and failing to provide it within the mandated timing requirements, Lucner Charles has violated the RESPA regulation 24 CFR 3500 and the Memorandum.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 78, by providing mortgage loan applicants with a Borrower's Certification and Authorization Form that contains language that presents the appearance that Lucner Charles is approving or funding a loan, Lucner Charles has violated the Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 78, by failing to provide mortgage loan applicants with the Attorney General's Mortgage Broker Disclosure Form in accordance with, and in the form specified by, the Attorney General's regulations and failing to provide the Form within the mandated timing requirements, Lucner Charles has violated the Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.05(1) and 8.05(5).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 78, by failing to retain all copies of the Loan Origination and Compensation Agreement provided to consumers, Lucner Charles has violated the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(5) and 209 CMR 42.09(1)(b).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 78, by failing to notify the Division of any change or closing of a Massachusetts office location, Lucner Charles has violated the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.13(2).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 78," the Commissioner has determined that: 	 Lucner Charles has engaged in", is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that Mass Financial Mortgage is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage broker including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. ; and  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an Order to cease and desist to Lucner Charles.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 78, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of Lucner Charles's original mortgage broker license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in paragraphs 1 through 78 present sufficient grounds for the revocation of Lucner Charles's mortgage broker license pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E," section 6 and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.07(2)(b). 	 C. ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein", it is hereby:  ORDERED that Lucner Charles and any and all employees and independent contractors operating on behalf of Lucner Charles, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of a mortgage broker, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this ORDER.

ORDER  NOW COME the parties in the above-captioned matter, the Division and Vertical Lend, and stipulate and agree as follows:  Upon the execution of this CONSENT ORDER, Vertical Lend voluntarily agrees not to renew its Massachusetts mortgage broker license number MB1884 which expired on May 31, 2007, and voluntarily agrees to surrender such license, and all rights thereunder, by returning the original license certificate to the Division at One South Station, 3  rd Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02110. In addition, Vertical Lend voluntarily agrees to withdraw its pending application for a mortgage broker license for an office located at 471 Western Avenue, Lynn, Massachusetts, which was received by the Division on January 29, 2007.  Having surrendered its license, Vertical Lend agrees not to engage in the mortgage broker and mortgage lender business in Massachusetts, as those terms are defined under General Laws chapter 255E, section 1.  To the extent that Vertical Lend wishes to engage in the business of a licensed mortgage broker and/or mortgage lender, Vertical Lend shall be required to submit a completed application to obtain the relevant license from the Commissioner. Unless the Commissioner, in his sole discretion, agrees to accept such an application earlier, Vertical Lend agrees not to submit such an application until at least one hundred and eighty (180) days have elapsed following the effective date of this CONSENT ORDER. The Commissioner shall have all of the discretion set forth within General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.00  et seq . in determining whether to issue a license to Vertical Lend to conduct the licensed business, provided however, that any such application shall not be denied solely on the basis of the ORDER AND NOTICE.  In determining whether Vertical Lend has satisfactorily demonstrated that it meets or exceeds the minimum standards for holding a mortgage broker and/or mortgage lender license, the Commissioner will consider whether Vertical Lend has successfully developed and implemented revised internal policies and quality control procedures as set forth in: this CONSENT ORDER; the findings of the Report; and as specifically enumerated in Paragraph 6 of this CONSENT ORDER.  Within five (5) days of the effective date of this CONSENT ORDER, Vertical Lend agrees to provide the Division with written certification that it has successfully notified each of the mortgage lender(s) or financial institution(s) to which Vertical Lend was placing Massachusetts residential mortgage loans prior to the issuance of the ORDER AND NOTICE that the Corporation is no longer conducting any mortgage broker activity in Massachusetts. This notification shall provide the mortgage lender or financial institution with accurate contact information of a designated individual both at Vertical Lend and at Vertical Lend's attorney's office that the mortgage lender or financial institution may contact if any mortgage broker activity is attempted to be conducted through the lender or financial institution by an individual or entity purporting to operate on behalf of Vertical Lend. 	 Upon execution of this CONSENT ORDER, Vertical Lend agrees to take all reasonable steps to prevent any former officers, directors, employees, their successors and assigns, and those persons in active participation with it, directly or indirectly, from acting under the apparent authority of Vertical Lend to conduct unlicensed mortgage broker activity in Massachusetts. In addition to the lender notification provisions of the preceding paragraph, Vertical Lend agrees to take appropriate steps to limit or terminate any online application submission authorities which are necessary to effect compliance with this CONSENT ORDER and Vertical Lend agrees to immediately notify the Division if any mortgage lender or financial institution should contact Vertical Lend regarding any attempted lending or brokering activity.  In order for the Commissioner to find that Vertical Lend meets the licensing standards applicable to mortgage lender and/or mortgage broker applicants , Vertical Lend must demonstrate to the Division's satisfaction that it has successfully developed and implemented effective internal controls and taken the affirmative measures described below. In order that the Commissioner may evaluate the measures implemented by Vertical Lend, Vertical Lend agrees that the Division shall have the full authority to conduct an examination/inspection of Vertical Lend's books, records, accounts, procedures, and policies so that a finding on such license application can be made. Notwithstanding Vertical Lend's unlicensed status at the time of the examination/inspection, it is understood that such examination/inspection shall be conducted under the provisions set forth in General Laws chapter 255E, section 8. The Division agrees to process any completed application to obtain the relevant license from the Commissioner submitted by Vertical Lend in an appropriate and timely manner. 	 Vertical Lend agrees to draft or revise, as applicable, a written compliance program designed to maintain compliance by Vertical Lend with all state and federal laws and regulations governing the conduct and operation of a mortgage lender and/or mortgage broker in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The compliance program, at a minimum, shall: 		 Provide for a loan review process to assess the compliance of Vertical Lend, and all applicable employees, staff, and independent contractors who operate on behalf of the Corporation, with (1) the statutes, regulations, regulatory bulletins, and other relevant provisions of law applicable to those engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and/or mortgage broker in Massachusetts and (2) the provisions of this CONSENT ORDER;  Ensure that Vertical Lend's compliance program is managed by a qualified manager who shall have responsibility for all consumer compliance and related matters, including, but not limited to, monitoring the Corporation's compliance and ensuring that corrective action is taken to address all alleged violations and areas of concern previously identified by the Division; and  Provide adequate training to applicable staff persons, conducted by qualified and trained personnel, which includes, but is not limited to, proper instruction, adequate supervision and ongoing training to ensure proper implementation and execution of the revised policies and procedures implemented pursuant to this CONSENT ORDER.  Vertical Lend agrees to review and revise the Corporation's policies and procedures to ensure that any loan fees, application fees, processing fees, or similar fees collected as compensation for administrative costs incurred in originating or underwriting the mortgage loan, are not charged to consumers except to the extent that such fees or points have been properly disclosed to the consumer, in writing, prior to the closing of the mortgage loan. 		 The Corporation agrees to cause to be made a review of all Massachusetts residential mortgage loans originated by Vertical Lend since November 12, 2003, and agrees to identify all mortgage loan transactions in which the amount actually paid by the consumer as a loan fee, mortgage broker fee, application fee, or similar fee, as recorded on the settlement statement, exceeded the amount disclosed to the consumer, in writing, for such fees prior to closing;  In each mortgage loan transaction identified pursuant to Paragraph 6(b)(i) of this CONSENT ORDER, Vertical Lend agrees to reimburse the consumer the difference between the actual charge assessed to the individual consumer as a loan fee, mortgage broker fee, processing fee, or similar fee and the amount disclosed in writing for such fees prior to closing;  Within ninety (90) days of the effective date of this CONSENT ORDER, Vertical Lend agrees to submit to the Commissioner a list of all borrowers identified pursuant to the above described review of residential mortgage loan transactions, including those borrowers specifically identified in the Report, to whom a reimbursement is owed by the Corporation in accordance with this Paragraph of the CONSENT ORDER;  Within one hundred and twenty (120) days of the effective date of this CONSENT ORDER, Vertical Lend agrees to submit evidence of all reimbursements issued to consumers pursuant to this Paragraph of the CONSENT ORDER, including the consumers' names, the dates the loans closed, check numbers, the amount of the reimbursements, and sufficient evidence to illustrate the consumers' receipt of the reimbursements; and  Vertical Lend agrees to ensure that a system of internal controls is established to monitor the Corporation's compliance with the revised practices and procedures established and implemented pursuant to this Paragraph of the CONSENT ORDER.  Vertical Lend agrees to review and revise the Corporation's policies and procedures to ensure that the Corporation does not conduct any mortgage broker or mortgage lender activity relative to Massachusetts residential mortgages from any office location that is not licensed with the Division. This Paragraph of the CONSENT ORDER shall apply during the 180 day period as well as at all subsequent times thereafter in which Vertical Lend holds a license from the Division.  Vertical Lend agrees to review and revise the Corporation's policies and procedures to ensure that Vertical Lend does not solicit or accept residential mortgage loan applications for property located in Massachusetts from any unlicensed individual or entity engaging in the activity of a mortgage broker or mortgage lender, who is not employed by Vertical Lend or who otherwise fails to qualify for exemption from licensure under the provisions of General Laws chapter 255E, section 2, in accordance with the requirements for exemption as set forth by the Division in Opinions 96-221, 97-061, and 97-222, which may from time to time be revised by the Commissioner.  Vertical Lend agrees to review and revise the Corporation's policies and procedures to ensure that, when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker, Vertical Lend will not charge or collect from consumers loan discount fees, tax service fees, or other compensation from consumers (i) in consideration of services which the Corporation, as a mortgage broker, is prohibited from performing in a mortgage loan transaction or (ii) where no, or only a nominal, service is provided by the Corporation. 		 Vertical Lend agrees to conduct a review of all Massachusetts residential mortgage loans brokered by the Corporation since December 4, 2001, or the earliest date from which Vertical Lend is able to access the pertinent records, whichever is earlier, but in no event later than May 30, 2003, and agrees to identify all consumers from whom Vertical Lend collected any loan discount fees, tax service fees, or other unearned fees: (1) in consideration of services which the Corporation, as a mortgage broker, was prohibited from performing in a mortgage loan transaction; or (2) where no, or only a nominal, service was provided by the Corporation. In the event that Vertical Lend's review evidences that it provided Massachusetts borrowers with written disclosures prior to the date of the loan closing which indicated that Vertical Lend would charge a fee permitted to be charged by a mortgage broker under Massachusetts law and a third party (e.g., a wholesale mortgage lender or a settlement attorney) caused that fee to be characterized as another type of fee in the preparation of the settlement statement, the Division agrees to individually review pertinent documentation and, subject to its full satisfaction, will not require a reimbursement to such borrower in the amount of the previously disclosed permissible fee.  In each mortgage loan transaction identified pursuant to Paragraph 6(e)(i) of this CONSENT ORDER, Vertical Lend agrees to reimburse the consumer for the total amount of the unearned fee collected; and  Within ninety (90) days of the effective date of this CONSENT ORDER, Vertical Lend agrees to submit to the Commissioner a list of all borrowers identified pursuant to the above described review of residential mortgage loan transactions, to whom a reimbursement is owed by the Corporation in accordance with this Paragraph of the CONSENT ORDER;  Within one hundred and twenty (120) days of the effective date of this CONSENT ORDER, Vertical Lend agrees to submit evidence of all reimbursements issued to consumers pursuant to this Paragraph of the CONSENT ORDER, including the consumers' names, the dates the loans closed, check numbers, the amount of the reimbursements, and sufficient evidence to illustrate the consumers' receipt of the reimbursements; and  Vertical Lend agrees to ensure that a system of internal controls is established to monitor the Corporation's compliance with the revised practices and procedures established and implemented pursuant to this Paragraph of the CONSENT ORDER.  Vertical Lend agrees to establish, implement, and maintain written policies and procedures to ensure that the Corporation maintains all books, records, and accounts in accordance with the requirements of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.09. The policies and procedures are to include but are not limited to: 		 Implementing procedures to ensure that Vertical Lend maintains original paper copies of all records relating to Massachusetts residential loans. Such procedures shall ensure that the Corporation retains the entire loan file relative to each mortgage loan, including all documentation provided by the lender in a brokered transaction. It being understood that Vertical Lend shall have the opportunity to petition the Commissioner for approval of a plan to maintain such records in electronic format by completing the required forms as part of any subsequent license application;  Providing that Vertical Lend conducts on-going, periodic reviews of document filing and retention procedures, and its compliance thereto, to ensure its books, records, and accounts are maintained in a manner sufficient to evidence compliance with applicable federal and state laws, rules and regulations;  Implementing procedures to ensure the full cooperation of all Vertical Lend employees with the Division during any future examinations of the Corporation which shall necessarily provide for complete and timely access to its books, records, accounts, and any other additional, relevant materials pursuant to the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8; and  Providing that all applicable staff of Vertical Lend with form completion and/or document filing and retention responsibilities, receive adequate training to ensure proper implementation and execution of the revised policies and procedures adopted by the Corporation under this Paragraph of the CONSENT ORDER.  Vertical Lend agrees to review and revise the Corporation's policies and procedures to ensure that the Corporation provides all applicable consumers an Attorney General's Disclosure Form, completed in accordance with, and in the form specified by, the provisions of the Office of the Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.05.  Vertical Lend agrees to review and revise the Corporation's policies and procedures to ensure that the Corporation, when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker, will refrain from providing any consumer with any disclosure which, pursuant to the applicable statute, regulation, or regulatory bulletin, is intended to be issued exclusively by the lender or creditor in the residential mortgage loan transaction.  Vertical Lend agrees to review and revise its polices and procedures to ensure that the Corporation accurately discloses yield spread premiums, as a dollar amount or range, on good faith estimates in accordance with the provisions of Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) implementing regulation 24 CFR 3500.7. Such procedures shall necessarily ensure that, when the yield spread premium is disclosed as an estimate or range, such amount set forth in the good faith estimate shall be based upon the Corporation's experience in collecting yield spread premiums in similar transactions and shall provide the consumer with an accurate estimate of the amount that is likely to be collected.  Vertical Lend agrees to review and revise the Corporation's policies and procedures to ensure that the Corporation refrains from making any representations or statements that could be considered false, misleading, or have the tendency to be misleading, including, but not limited to, any representation that the Corporation is approving or funding the loan when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker. 		 Vertical Lend agrees to review and amend as necessary all documentation provided to consumers, including but not limited to, its ""Certification and Authorization"" form.  Vertical Lend, when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker, agrees to refrain from issuing documentation indicating that a home loan is in a borrower's interest pursuant to the Division's regulation 209 CMR 53.07 or any other documentation that would present the appearance that Vertical Lend is making an affirmative determination that a home loan is in the borrower's interest.  Vertical Lend agrees to review and revise the Corporation's policies and procedures to ensure that all consumers receive a loan origination and compensation agreement in accordance with the provisions of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.16. Such procedures shall necessarily ensure that the content of the loan origination and compensation agreement strictly conforms to 209 CMR 42.16.  Vertical Lend agrees to review and revise the Corporation's policies and procedures to ensure that the Division is notified of any ""significant events"" within the appropriate timing requirements, in compliance with 209 CMR 42.12.  Vertical Lend agrees to review and revise the Corporation's policies and procedures to ensure that all Annual Reports are submitted to the Division in a timely fashion, in compliance with M.G.L. c. 255E, section 8.  Vertical Lend agrees to review and revise the Corporation's policies and procedures to ensure that the Corporation will at all times conduct business in Massachusetts exclusively under the business name in which the relevant license was obtained from the Commissioner.  Vertical Lend agrees to review and revise the Corporation's policies and procedures to ensure that, when applicable, the Corporation provides consumers with a Credit Score Disclosure, in compliance with the requirements of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Section 609(g)(1). For each consumer loan file, a completed copy of the Credit Score Disclosure shall be retained in the Corporation's books and records as evidence of compliance.  Vertical Lend agrees to review and revise the Corporation's policies and procedures to ensure that all consumers receive a Notice of Privacy Policies and Practices in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's Regulation 16 CFR 313.  Vertical Lend agrees to establish and implement quality control standards which provide for a loan review process to assess the Corporation's compliance with: (i) the statutes, rules, regulations, regulatory bulletins, and other relevant provisions of law applicable to those engaged in the business of a mortgage broker and/or mortgage lender in Massachusetts and (ii) the provisions of this CONSENT ORDER. Such quality control standards shall be designed to prevent the recurrence of the violations and areas of concern addressed in the Report.  Vertical Lend agrees to establish and implement procedures and policies to ensure that all applicable staff persons shall receive adequate instruction and ongoing, periodic training to ensure proper implementation and execution of the revised practices and procedures implemented pursuant to this CONSENT ORDER.  Within ninety (90) days of the effective date of this CONSENT ORDER, the Corporation agrees to submit to the Commissioner a written report, accompanied by an executed Secretary's Certificate to reflect that the Corporation's Board of Directors has reviewed such report, which addresses: 	 the identification of the type and number of senior management and officer personnel necessary to manage adequately and supervise properly the Corporation's mortgage lender and/or broker activity;  a statement that each individual identified pursuant to subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph of the CONSENT ORDER possesses the ability, experience, and other qualifications necessary to perform competently present and anticipated duties, to follow and enforce the Corporation's revised policies and procedures adopted pursuant to this CONSENT ORDER, and to comply with the provisions of this CONSENT ORDER; and  A determination of the level of staffing needed to conduct competently the Corporation's operations affecting Massachusetts consumers.  The provisions of this CONSENT ORDER shall not limit, estop, or otherwise prevent the Division, or any state agency or department, from taking any other action affecting Vertical Lend, its officers, directors, employees, successors and assigns, and those persons in active participation with it, directly or indirectly, acting individually or through any corporate or other entity, with respect to matters not addressed in the ORDER AND NOTICE or this CONSENT ORDER.  This CONSENT ORDER shall become effective immediately upon the date of its issuance.  The provisions of this CONSENT ORDER shall be binding upon Vertical Lend and its officers and directors, and their successors or assigns.  Failure to comply with the terms of this CONSENT ORDER shall constitute grounds for license denial, suspension, and/or revocation pursuant to applicable provisions of the General Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  It is agreed that no action to enforce this CONSENT ORDER in the Superior Court will be taken by the Commissioner except after notice to Vertical Lend and unless Vertical Lend, or its officers and/or directors, or their successors or assigns, have violated, or is about to violate, any provision of the CONSENT ORDER.  In accordance with the terms of the CONSENT AGREEMENT entered by Vertical Lend and the Commissioner, Vertical Lend has waived all rights of appeal that it may have.  The provisions of this CONSENT ORDER shall remain effective and enforceable except to the extent that, and until such time as, any provisions of this CONSENT ORDER shall have been modified, terminated, suspended, or set aside by the Commissioner or upon an order of a court of competent jurisdiction.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE LENDER AND  MORTGAGE BROKER  LICENSING  Docket No. 2008-003  FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  MASS LENDING, LLC  Needham, Massachusetts  Mortgage Company License No(s). MC4133 and MC4667  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that MASS LENDING, LLC (""Mass Lending"" or the ""Company""), located at 220 Reservoir Street, Suite 28, Needham, Massachusetts has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""Temporary Order"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  Mass Lending is, and at all relevant times has been, a Massachusetts limited liability company doing business in the Commonwealth. Mass Lending's main office is located at 220 Reservoir Street, Suite 28, Needham, Massachusetts.  Mass Lending is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage lender and mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage company license, license number MC4133, to Mass Lending to engage in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker on or about December 7, 2005. License number MC4133 authorized Mass Lending to conduct the mortgage company business from the Company's main office located at 220 Reservoir Street, Suite 28, Needham, Massachusetts.  Mass Lending maintains an additional licensed office location at 476A Saratoga Street, East Boston, Massachusetts, from which the Company conducts its mortgage lender and mortgage broker business. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner issued a mortgage company license, license number MC4667, to Mass Lending for that location on or about January 12, 2007.  Mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers in Massachusetts are licensed and regulated under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, which is administered and enforced by the Commissioner. Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division is authorized to inspect the books, accounts, papers, records, and files of mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers transacting business in Massachusetts to determine compliance with the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E and any rule, or regulation issued thereunder, and with any law, rule, or regulation applicable to the conduct of the business of a mortgage lender or mortgage broker.  On October 24, 2007, pursuant to the authority granted under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division commenced an examination/inspection of the books, accounts, papers, records, and files maintained by Mass Lending to evaluate the Company's compliance with the laws, regulations, and regulatory bulletins applicable to the conduct of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker business in Massachusetts (the ""2007 examination/inspection"").  The Division's Report of Examination/Inspection (the ""Report""), which was issued to Mass Lending on the effective date of this Temporary Order, presented the findings of the 2007 examination/inspection and alleged significant failures to comply with applicable state and federal laws, rules, regulations, and regulatory bulletins governing the conduct of those engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts. 	 A. Unfair or Deceptive Acts and Practices  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(8), effective as of September, 8, 2006, states: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker of mortgage lender to falsify income or asset information on a mortgage loan application or mortgage loan documents.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) states: 	 Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1) states, in part: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to make any representation or statement of fact if the representation or statement is false or misleading or has the tendency or capacity to be misleading.  The 2007 examination/inspection revealed that Mass Lending falsified asset and income information on mortgage loan documents relating to loans originated by the Company. Examples include, but are not limited to the following documents, as summarized below: 	 Loan #1493432. Redacted copies of the documents are attached hereto as Exhibit 1 and are incorporated by reference. 		 A stated income loan application, for a loan which closed on November 27, 2006, indicated that the gross monthly base employment income of the applicant, a registered nurse, was $6,600, or $79,200 annually.  A copy of the Request of Verification of Employment (VOE) form contained in the loan file submitted by Mass Lending to the Division's examiners indicated that the Applicant worked an average of 36 hours per week at an hourly rate of $26.57.  The income figures noted above in the VOE form appear to have been obscured by ""white-out"" tape prior to submitting a copy of the form to the mortgage lender. The income figures on the VOE are legible under the ""white-out"" tape but would have been obscured in the photocopied VOE that had been submitted to the mortgage lender.  The discrepancy in income reveals an overstatement of the applicant's gross annual income of approximately $29,460.  Loan #1434770. Redacted copies of the documents are attached hereto as Exhibit 2 and are incorporated by reference. 		 A stated income loan application for a loan which closed on October 26, 2006 indicated that the gross monthly base employment income of the applicant, a personal care attendant for two individuals, was $6,213, or $74,556 annually.  Copies of two pay checks in the loan file (each check representing separate payment per each one of the individuals cared for) reflect a year to date income of $6,542.00 and $10,953.92, respectively, as of October 14, 2006.  A copy of a form completed as a result of a Mass Health evaluation indicates that the applicant worked approximately 14.25 hours per week for one of the two individuals the applicant cared for.  The income and employment information referenced above were altered prior to submitting the information to the lender. Specifically, the income figures reflected on both checks were altered using ""white-out"" tape prior to copying and submitting the checks to the mortgage lender. In addition, the copy of the evaluation form submitted by Mass Health was altered by Mass Lending to indicate that that applicant worked approximately 24.25 hours instead of 14.25 hours. The original information on the documents is legible under the ""white-out"" tape but would have been obscured in the photocopied documents that had been submitted to the mortgage lender.  The discrepancy in income reveals overstatement of the applicant's gross annual income of approximately $52,499.  Loan # 1559441. Redacted copies of the documents are attached hereto as Exhibit 3. 		 A stated income loan application for a loan which closed on January 10, 2007 indicated that the gross monthly income of the applicant was $21,450, or $257,400 annually. In addition, the application indicated that the applicant maintained savings accounts with Ben Franklin Bank and Middlesex Savings Bank with balances of $7,000 and $16,000, respectively.  Verification of Deposit forms contained in the loan file and submitted by Mass Lending to the Division's examiners for review appear to indicate that one individual had completed all forms. Specifically, the forms, purportedly completed by Ben Franklin Bank and Middlesex Bank and ""signed"" by the respective officers of the banks, appear to have been written using the same ink and in the same handwriting.  After reviewing a copy of the Ben Franklin Bank Verification of Deposit form contained in Mass Lending's loan files, an officer of Ben Franklin Bank confirmed via telephone on November 6, 2007 that the form had not been completed by any member of the bank and, furthermore, that the information and signature reflected on the Verification of Deposit were inaccurate.  The individual who purportedly signed the Middlesex Savings Bank Verification of Deposit Form notified the Division via telephone on November 5, 2007 that she does not typically complete such forms. Moreover, she stated that the signature as described on the form included a nickname that is not consistent with her signature.  The Division's examiners confirmed that the above referenced fabricated VOD forms were submitted by Mass Lending to the lender for loan qualification and underwriting purposes.  Loan #206-676522. Redacted copies of the documents are attached hereto as Exhibit 4 and are incorporated by reference. 		 A stated income and asset loan application for a loan which closed on July 21, 2006 indicated that the gross monthly base employment income of the applicant was $7,600, or $91,299 annually. In addition, the application indicated that the applicant maintained a savings account and checking account with Bank of America with balances of $15,000 and $4,000, respectively.  The final application signed at closing reflects an increase in the applicant's gross monthly income to $9,000, or $108,000 annually. Assets on the final application consist of Bank of America accounts with $15,000 and $1,800, respectively.  On November 14, 2007, the Division's examiner contacted the applicant to verify the income reflected on the application. The applicant indicated that he earns approximately $40,000 to $50,000 annually working at a family owned business and receives the rest in ""family contributions from overseas.""  Loan #1565960. Redacted copies of the documents are attached hereto as Exhibit 5 and are incorporated by reference. 		 A stated income loan application for a loan which closed on January 16, 2007 indicated that the gross monthly base employment income of the applicant, a certified nurse's assistant at an assisted living facility, was $5,250, or $63,000 annually.  A representative of the applicant's employer confirmed that she completed a Verification of Employment form (VOE) which did not include salary information.  Mass Lending submitted to the lender for loan qualification purposes a letter dated January 10, 2007, purportedly from the employer's representative, which indicated that the applicant's annual salary ranged from $52,500 to $68,500.  The representative of the applicant's employer notified the Division via telephone on November 7, 2007 that she did not write the letter referenced above and, moreover, the salary noted in the letter was a ""gross overstatement.""  Loan #1524395. Redacted copies of the documents are attached hereto as Exhibit 6 and are incorporated by reference. 		 A verified asset loan application for a loan which closed on January 3, 2007 indicated that the applicant maintained a bank account with ""Citizens Bank"" with a balance of $25,000.  A representative of Citizen's Bank confirmed verbally that VOD form had been completed by an assistant branch manager of Citizen's Bank indicating that the applicant's checking account balance as of December 14, 2006 was $5,000, with an average balance for the previous two months of $4,199.  An inspection of the forms provided by the Company to the Division's examiners revealed that the VOD referenced above had been visibly altered using black pen ink and ""white-out"" liquid to indicate that the applicant's balance as of December 14, 2006 was $15,000 with an average balance for the previous two months of $10,199.  Loan #1464101. Redacted copies of the documents are attached hereto as Exhibit 7 and are incorporated by reference. 		 A verified asset loan application for a loan which closed on November 6, 2006 indicated that the applicant maintained a bank account at Hometown Bank with a balance of $6,785.  A manager at Hometown Bank confirmed via telephone on November 14, 2007 that the VOD form submitted by Mass Lending to the lender for loan qualification purposes, which indicated that the applicant's bank account had a balance of $6,821 as of the application date, appeared to be fabricated. Specifically, the name of the branch manager listed on the VOD was incorrect; the date the account opened should have read September 4, 2003 but was listed as 2000; and the actual balance in the applicant's account as of the date of the VOD was $346.86.  The discrepancy between the information received from Hometown Bank and the information submitted to the lender by Mass Lending reveals that Mass Lending overstated the applicant's account balance by $6,438.14.  Loan #5100010224. Redacted copies of the documents are attached hereto as Exhibit 8 and are incorporated by reference. 		 A stated income loan application for a loan which closed on September 15, 2006 indicated that the gross monthly base employment income of the applicant, a nursing assistant at a nursing home and operations manager at a local market, was $8,500, or $102,000 annually.  The Division's examiners contacted the employers referenced in the application by phone and determined that the applicant had never been employed at the businesses referenced in the application.  Loan #1270660. Redacted copies of the documents are attached hereto as Exhibit 9 and are incorporated by reference. 		 A verified asset loan application for a loan which closed on July 19, 2006 included VODs that indicated that the applicant maintained two bank checking accounts at Bank of America with balances of $4,296.58 and $3,398.07.  The VOD forms contained in the loan file appear to indicate that the VOD had been fabricated by Mass Lending.  The individual bank officer who purportedly signed the VOD forms on behalf of Bank of America notified the Division via telephone on November 16, 2007 that he had never completed a VOD form on behalf of Bank of America, nor had he ever been asked to complete such a form in his current capacity at the bank. Moreover, after reviewing a copy of the VOD form, the bank representative confirmed that the signature as appearing on the form did not resemble his own signature and the date listed as the opening date of one of the accounts was incorrect. However, the bank officer was unable to assess whether the account information was inaccurate.  The Division's examiners confirmed that the above referenced fabricated VOD forms were submitted by Mass Lending to the lender for loan qualification and underwriting purposes.  Loan #1526202. Redacted copies of the documents are attached hereto as Exhibit 10 and are incorporated by reference. 		 A verified income and asset loan application for a loan which closed on December 19, 2007 indicated that the gross monthly base employment income of the applicant was $4,845 or $58,140 annually. According to the application, the applicant was employed as a ""sales associate/estimator"" at a MaidPro franchise in Chelmsford, Massachusetts. In addition, the application indicated that the applicant maintained a checking account at the Colorado-based Bank of the West with an account balance of $3,000.  Verification of Deposit and Verification of Employment Forms contained in the loan file and submitted by Mass Lending to the Division's examiners for review appear to indicate that one individual had completed both forms. Specifically, the VOD form purportedly completed and signed by a branch manager at Bank of the West and the VOE form purportedly completed and signed by the owner of the MaidPro Chelmsford branch appear to have been written using the same ink and in the same handwriting.  After reviewing a faxed copy of the VOD form allegedly completed by a representative of Bank of the West, a branch supervisor of the bank confirmed via telephone on November 18, 2007 that the signature on the form was not authentic and the date listed on the VOD as the date the account opened was incorrect. However, the branch supervisor was unable to assess whether the account balance information was inaccurate.  The VOE referenced above indicated that the applicant earned $42,565 in 2004 and $44,965 in 2005 while employed at MaidPro. After reviewing a faxed copy of the VOE, the MaidPro Chelmsford branch owner who had purportedly completed and signed the VOE confirmed via telephone on November 20, 2007 that the signature on the form was not authentic and she had not yet become the owner of the branch as the VOE's completion date. However, the branch owner was unable to assess whether the income information was inaccurate.  Loan #1541707. Redacted copies of the documents are attached hereto as Exhibit 11 and are incorporated by reference. 		 A verified asset loan application for a loan which closed on December 27, 2006 included a VOD form indicating that the applicant maintained a checking account and a savings account at Citizen's Bank with balances of $32,184 and $85,892, respectively.  A representative of Citizen's Bank notified the Division via telephone in November 19, 2007 that the checking account number referenced in the VOD is not the account number associated with the applicant's checking account, but is the account number associated with the checking account of a different individual who had applied for a mortgage loan through Mass Lending. In addition, the savings account number referenced in the VOD was not associated with the applicant's savings account. The representative also confirmed that the Citizen's Bank accounts opened by the applicant had been closed several years prior to the date the VOD was completed.  Loan #1357208. Redacted copies of the documents are attached hereto as Exhibit 12 and are incorporated by reference 		 A verified asset loan application for a loan which closed on September 1, 2006 included a VOD form indicating that the applicant maintained an account at Eastern Bank with a balance of $5,200.  The branch manager who purportedly signed the VOD referenced above informed the Division via telephone on August 29, 2006 that, although the bank account balance information appeared to be accurate as of the date the VOD was completed, she had not completed the form and the signature appearing on the VOD was not authentic.  The Division's examiners confirmed that the above referenced fabricated VOD forms were submitted by Mass Lending to the lender for loan qualification and underwriting purposes.  Mass Lending knew or should have known that the above referenced income and/or asset information would be relied upon in underwriting the mortgage loan by the mortgage lender or financial institution to which the mortgage loan applications were brokered by Mass Lending.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(7), effective as of September 8, 2006, states: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker or mortgage lender to sign a consumer's name to a mortgage loan application or mortgage loan documents on behalf of a consumer.  The 2007 examination/inspection revealed that Mass Lending engaged in a pattern or practice of ""e-copying"" consumers' signatures and affixing them on numerous mortgage loan documents using software that enabled the Company to electronically reproduce signatures after scanning the consumers' original signatures as appearing on other documents that were in the Company's possession. The Division's investigation revealed that the e-copied signatures originated from sources including, but not limited to, initial disclosures, Purchase and Sales Agreements, driver's licenses and cancelled checks.  Upon further inquiry, Mass Lending explained that the initial disclosures that were signed by the consumers were ultimately destroyed by the Company because, in most cases, the original loan terms had changed and new disclosures were then produced.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(6), effective as of September 8, 2006, states: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker or mortgage lender to have a consumer sign a blank or incomplete mortgage loan application or mortgage loan documents.  Files reviewed by the Division's examiners pursuant to the 2007 examination/inspection revealed instances in which applicants signed blank or incomplete initial disclosure forms, including but not limited to, Loan Origination and Compensation Agreements and Attorney General's Mortgage Broker Disclosure.  The 2007 examination/inspection revealed that Mass Lending concealed and/or misrepresented certain pertinent information in mortgage loan documents submitted to lenders for loan qualification/approval and underwriting purposes. Examples include but are not limited to the following: 	 A review of the mortgage loan file #1174471, for a loan which closed on May 5, 2006, revealed that the insurance binder pertaining to the insurance coverage on the subject property had been altered by Mass Lending to obscure the statement, ""Policy to cancel on 5/3/06 $258.00 due."" Specifically, the language regarding cancellation was obscured with ""white-out"" tape to conceal the evidence that the premium was past due and that the policy was scheduled to cancel. The information on the insurance binder is legible under the ""white-out"" tape but would have been obscured in the photocopy of the binder that had been submitted to the mortgage lender.  Books and records reviewed during the 2007 examination/inspection revealed several instances in which Mass Lending had submitted to lenders mortgage loan applications for two or more properties on behalf of a single borrower, with each such application indicating that the subject property was to be used as a primary residence. Details regarding these loan transactions are specifically described in the Report.  B. Undisclosed Fees  	   Massachusetts General Laws chapter 183, section 63 states, in part: 	 A mortgagee, or a mortgage lender or mortgage broker as defined in section one of chapter two hundred and fifty-five E, shall not charge a loan fee, finder's fee, points, so-called, or similar fees in a mortgage transaction involving residential property located in the commonwealth of four or less units and occupied in whole or in part by the mortgagor, except to the extent that such fees or points have been previously disclosed to the mortgagor in writing, which disclosure may be in the form required by section seventeen D of chapter one hundred and eighty-four, or such other form which discloses said fees or points. A mortgagor shall not be obligated to pay fees or points which have not been previously disclosed as required herein.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2007 examination/inspection indicate that the Company engaged in a pattern or practice of understatements or omissions of the fees charged to consumers by Mass Lending.  The Company's books and records indicate that processing fees, application fees, loan fees, or similar fees (collectively, ""broker fees"") were collected at the loan closing in amounts which the Division's examiners were unable to confirm had been accurately disclosed to consumers, in writing, to the extent charged at closing, if at all. Specifically, because of Mass Lending's practice of ""e-copying"" consumers' signatures and affixing them to various disclosure forms as described in Paragraphs 14 through 15 of this Temporary Order, the Division's examiners were unable to confirm that any of the broker fees noted on the disclosure forms had, in fact, been disclosed to the consumers prior to the loan closing. (See Exhibit 13 which is attached and incorporated herein by reference). 	 C. Failure to Provide Notification of Regulatory Action  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.12(1)(c) states, in part: 	 A Licensee shall notify the Commissioner immediately, and in writing within one business day, of the occurrence of any of the following significant developments: . . . (c) [R]eceiving notification of the institution of license . . . revocation procedures, or other formal or informal regulatory action, in any state against the Licensee, and the reasons thereof.  On July 30, 2007, the State of New Hampshire Banking Department (""New Hampshire Department"") issued a Cease and Desist Order, Case No. 07-185, against Mass Lending (""New Hampshire Order""). The New Hampshire Order alleges that during the course of an examination of a New Hampshire licensed entity, the New Hampshire Department became aware that the licensed entity had accepted at least ten (10) mortgage originations from Mass Lending, a Company that is not licensed as a mortgage broker in New Hampshire.  The New Hampshire Order states that as Mass Lending was not licensed by the New Hampshire Department, the Company was not entitled to any compensation under New Hampshire law.  As of the effective date of this Temporary Order, the Division has not received notification from Mass Lending of the occurrence of the events referenced above in Paragraphs 23 and 24 of this Temporary Order. 	 D. Failure to Timely Provide Notification of the Closing and Relocation of Licensed Office Locations  The Division's Regulation 209 CMR 42.13(2) states: 	 Licensees shall provide thirty days prior written notice of any change or closing of a Massachusetts location to the Commissioner and shall contain such other information as the Commissioner may require.  Books and records reviewed during the 2007 examination/inspection revealed that Mass Lending failed to provide thirty days prior notice of the relocation of its main office from Needham, Massachusetts to Norwood, Massachusetts. Specifically, Mass Lending's notification of the office relocation, effective as of June 1, 2007, was received by the Division on June 5, 2007.  Books and records reviewed during the 2007 examination/inspection revealed that Mass Lending failed to provide thirty days prior notice of the closing of its Allston, Massachusetts and Worcester, Massachusetts office locations. Specifically, Mass Lending surrendered its licenses for those branches on or about February 28, 2007 but the Division did not receive notice of such until February 28, 2007 and February 12, 2007, respectively. 	 E. Conducting Business with Unlicensed Entities  The Attorney General's Regulation 940 CMR 8.06(9) states: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to conduct business with a person which should be licensed under M.G.L. c. 255E, and which it knows or should know is an unlicensed mortgage broker or lender.  By prior published opinions, the Division has set forth the standards which an individual must satisfy, in advance, when seeking to operate in the capacity of an independent contractor associated with a licensed mortgage broker or mortgage lender under General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. The Division's published opinions have consistently held that the exemption from licensure referenced herein is available exclusively to individuals engaging in the licensed business in the name of the licensee and is not available to an independent corporation, partnership, association, or other legal entity that is separate and distinct from the legal entity in whose name the license was issued.  Books and records reviewed during the 2007 examination/inspection revealed that Mass Lending compensated certain unlicensed business entities for loans originated through Mass Lending, as specifically described in the Report. 	 F. Engaging Unauthorized Individuals to Originate Mortgage Loans in Massachusetts  	   Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2007 examination/inspection indicate that Mass Lending, at all relevant times, retained unlicensed individuals, who were acting in the capacity of mortgage brokers and who were associated with and under the direction of the Company to conduct the mortgage broker business.  By prior published opinions, the Division has set forth the standards which an unlicensed individual must satisfy, in advance, when seeking to operate in the capacity of a mortgage broker who is associated with and under the direction of a licensed mortgage broker under General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  Pursuant to the Division's published Opinion 97-222, the position of the Division of Banks is that exemption from licensure is available only to individuals and not to a corporate entity. The relationship between the licensee and the individual must be exclusive and the individual must execute an Exemption Affidavit to that effect. The licensee must execute a Statement of Accountability for all activities of the individual associated with it. The individual seeking the exemption must be primarily engaged in the activity it is seeking to perform under the direction of a licensed mortgage broker.  The Division's published Opinion 97-061 further states that ""this exemption would be effective provided that the Licensee completes and files with the Division a Statement of Accountability agreeing to take responsibility for the exempt individual's activities and the individual seeking the exemption completes and files the required Exemption Affidavit.""  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2007 examination/inspection revealed that Mass Lending did not file the required Exemption Affidavits and Statements of Accountability for any of the independent contractors who were operating on behalf of the Company.  Because Mass Lending had failed to file the aforementioned required Exemption Affidavits and Statements of Accountability, the Division was unable to determine if Mass Lending had satisfied the qualifying standards for unlicensed individuals acting in the capacity of mortgage brokers associated with and under the direction of a licensed mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders set forth by the relevant opinions published by the Division.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2007 examination/inspection revealed that seven individuals, as further identified in the Report, originated loans in Massachusetts on behalf of Mass Lending in their capacity as independent contractors, but were not engaged in the activity of a mortgage broker or mortgage lender as their primary occupation.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2007 examination/inspection revealed that three individuals originated loans in Massachusetts on behalf of Mass Lending while also working on behalf of other mortgage companies, as more fully described in the Report. 	 G. Unearned Fees  The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, (""RESPA"") implementing regulation, 24 CFR 3500.14(c)states, in part: 	 No person shall give and no person shall accept any portion, split, or percentage of any charge made or received for the rendering of a settlement service in connection with a transaction involving a federally related mortgage loan other than for services actually performed. A charge by a person for which no or nominal services are performed or for which duplicative fees are charged is an unearned fee and violates this section.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2007 examination/inspection indicate that when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker, Mass Lending engaged in a pattern or practice of charging consumers fees for which no service was rendered or services which Mass Lending was not authorized to perform as the mortgage broker. (See Exhibit 14 which is attached and incorporated herein by reference).  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2007 examination/inspection revealed that Mass Lending charged consumers ""underwriting fees."" Mortgage brokers are neither authorized to approve loan terms nor fund mortgage loans. Therefore, Mass Lending, when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker, would not be able to perform the service for which an underwriting fee would be collected. 	 H. Failure to Properly Maintain Books and Records  	   The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.09(1)(b) states: 	 Each Licensee shall keep and use its books, records and accounts in a",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

manner which will allow the Commissioner to determine whether the Licensee is complying with the provisions of M.G.L. c. 255E and applicable state and federal laws and regulations. Each Licensee shall comply with the provisions of 209 CMR 48.00...  (b)The mortgage broker ... shall retain for a minimum of three years after a mortgage loan is made the following: the original loan origination and compensation agreement as set out in 209 CMR 42.16; a copy of the settlement statement; an account of fees received in connection with the loan; correspondence; papers or records relating to the loan; and such other documents as the Commissioner may require.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2007 examination/inspection indicated that Mass Lending failed to retain sufficient documentation to enable the Commissioner to determine whether the Company was complying with certain laws and regulations governing mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders in Massachusetts, including but not limited to," compliance with mandated timing requirements. 	 Mass Lending's practice of """"e-copying"""" consumers' signatures and affixing them to various disclosure forms as described in Paragraph 14 of this Temporary Order prevented the Division's examiners from determining whether the Company was complying with the laws and regulations governing the provision of required mortgage disclosures.  Mass Lending's practice of destroying initial disclosures as described in Paragraph 15 of this Temporary Order prevented the Division's examiners from determining whether the Company was complying with M.G.L. c. 255E and applicable state and federal laws and regulations governing mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders.  I. Misrepresentations to the Division  According to a summary of professional experience which was prepared by Lisa Reed and presented to the Division's examiner during the 2007 examination/inspection", Lisa Reed, the current owner of Mass Lending, was formerly employed as a loan originator with APEX Financial Group, Inc., d/b/a AAPEX Mortgage from December 2005 through March 2007, and as a loan originator with Alpine Financial Services, LLC d/b/a Mortgageopia from October 2005 until December 2005.  Pursuant to the Division's licensing requirements," applicants for a mortgage license must identify the names of all """"control persons"""" for the applicant. Each person so designated as a """"control person"""" must submit the Uniform Mortgage Biographical Statement and Consent Form (""""MU2 Form""""). The MU2 Form must also be submitted in the event of a change of ownership of a licensee.  The MU2 Form requires", in part, that the control person provide a complete employment history for the past 10 years.  In March 2006, Mass Lending designated Lisa Reed as the proposed branch manager for Mass Lending's proposed West Roxbury location and was required to complete and submit to the Division the MU2 Form as part of the branch license application. Ms. Reed failed to include the employment information referenced above in Paragraph 45 of this Temporary Order, describing her employment history during the relevant period between December 2005 and March 2006 as being employed by Mass Lending.  In August 2006, when Mass Lending requested the Division's approval of a change of ownership, resulting in Ms. Reed becoming the new owner, Ms. Reed was again required to complete and submit an MU2 Form. Ms. Reed again failed to include the employment information referenced above in Paragraph 45 of this Temporary Order.  By signing the MU2, Ms. Reed swore or affirmed that her answers (including attachments) were true and complete and that she understood that she would be subject to administrative, civil, or criminal penalties for false or misleading answers.  Pursuant to the Division's licensing requirements, individuals to be designated as branch managers for a licensee must submit the MU2 Form. Such branch managers are subject to the Division's review and approval to ensure that the individuals possess the necessary educational and business experience to engage in the business of a mortgage broker or mortgage lender.  In its application for a license for a branch office location in East Boston, Mass Lending identified Ms. Reed as the branch manager. However, a review of Mass Lending's website revealed that another individual was listed as the branch manager of that location. Upon inquiry," the individual listed as branch manager confirmed that he was in fact the branch manager and that Ms. Reed """"never comes to this office."""" Ms. Reed later informed the Division's examiners that the current branch manager had been acting in the capacity of a branch manager since August 2007.  By failing to notify the Division of the identity of the actual branch manager of the East Boston office location and failing to submit the MU2 Form as required"," Mass Lending prevented the Division from reviewing the qualifications of the individual manager. 	 J. Refinancing in the Borrower's Interest  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 183"," section 28C(a) states in part: 	 A lender shall not knowingly make a home loan if the home loan pays off all or part of an existing home loan that was consummated within the prior 60 months or other debt of the borrower"," unless the refinancing is in the borrower's interest. The """"borrower's interest"""" shall be narrowly construed"," and the burden is upon the lender to determine that the refinancing is in the borrower's interest.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 53.07(1)(b) states in part: 	 A lender may request that a borrower acknowledge receipt of such a worksheet or other documentation; provided", however, a lender shall not shift the burden to the borrower to demonstrate that a home loan is in the borrowers' interest.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2007 examination/inspection revealed that when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker," Mass Lending provided consumers a """"Massachusetts Predatory/Net Tangible Benefit Worksheet"""" form (""""Worksheet"""")"," a document that only mortgage lenders are authorized to provide to borrowers. 	 Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2007 examination/inspection also revealed that the Worksheet provided to the applicable consumers shifted the burden to the consumers to demonstrate that the loan was in the borrowers' interest and to their benefit.  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 56", Mass Lending has failed to demonstrate the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 56, by falsifying borrowers' asset and income information on Uniform Residential Loan Applications and falsifying applicants' bank account information and employment information submitted in connection with residential mortgage transactions, Mass Lending has violated the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12(A)(8), Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) and the Office of the Attorney General's implementing regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 56, by e-copying consumers' signatures and affixing them on mortgage loan documents, Mass Lending has violated the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(7).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 56, by having consumers sign blank or incomplete disclosure forms, Mass Lending has violated the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(6).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 56, by charging loan fees, points, or similar fees in mortgage transactions involving residential property located in the Commonwealth, of four or less units and occupied in whole or in part by the mortgagor, without disclosing such fees or points to the mortgagor prior to the closing of the loan, Mass Lending has violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 183, section 63.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 56, Mass Lending failed to notify the Commissioner in writing, within one business day, that on July 30, 2007 the New Hampshire Banking Department issued a Cease and Desist Order in violation of the Division's Regulation 209 CMR 42.12(1)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 56, Mass Lending relocated its main office and closed two Massachusetts locations without first notifying the Commissioner, in writing, at least thirty days prior to the closing and relocation of the office locations, in violation of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.13(2).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 56, Mass Lending compensated unlicensed business entities for loans originated through the Company in violation of the Attorney General's Regulation 940 CMR 8.06(9).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 56, Mass Lending has solicited or accepted residential mortgage loan applications for property located in Massachusetts from individuals engaging in the activity of a mortgage broker who were not employed by the Company and who otherwise failed to qualify for an exemption from licensure as set forth by the Division by prior published opinions, including without limitation Opinions 96-221, 97-061, and 97-222 in violation of General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 56 by charging underwriting fees, when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker, in mortgage transactions involving residential property located in the Commonwealth, Mass Lending has violated the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and its implementing regulation, 24 CFR 3500.14(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 56, by failing to keep and use its books and records in a manner which would allow the Commissioner to determine whether the Company was complying with applicable state and federal laws and regulations, Mass Lending has violated the Division's regulations 209 CMR 42.09(1) and 209 CMR 48.03.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 56, by providing disclosures to consumers that only lenders are authorized to provide when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker, Mass Lending has violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 56," the Commissioner has determined that: 	 Mass Lending has engaged in", is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that it is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. ; and  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to Mass Lending.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 56, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of Mass Lending's original mortgage lender license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 56 present sufficient grounds for the revocation of Mass Lending's mortgage lender and mortgage broker licenses pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.04(2)(b), 42.07(2)(b)," and 42.12A(17). 	 ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein", it is hereby:  ORDERED that Mass Lending and any and all officers, directors, employees, independent contractors, or agents operating on behalf of Mass Lending, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Temporary Order. Therefore, Mass Lending is ordered to immediately cease soliciting or accepting, either directly or indirectly, any residential mortgage loan applications from consumers for residential property located in Massachusetts.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Mass Lending, shall immediately place any fees previously collected from Massachusetts consumers relative to any pending mortgage loan applications in a separate escrow account maintained at a federally insured bank.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Mass Lending shall immediately place with one or more qualified broker(s) or lender(s), as appropriate based on the status of the application and with no loss to applicants," all of its pending Massachusetts residential mortgage loan applications.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE BROKER  LICENSING  Docket No. 2008-004  FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  5K MORTGAGE CORPORATION  ANTHONY J. ANDERSEN, individually  LAURA ANDERSEN, individually  Florence, Massachusetts  Mortgage Broker License No. MB2971  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that 5K MORTGAGE CORPORATION, LLC, ANTHONY J. ANDERSEN, and LAURA ANDERSEN (collectively, ""5K Mortgage Corporation"" or the ""Corporation""), located at 28 Sylvan Lane, Florence, Massachusetts, 01062 has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""Temporary Order"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b).  A. FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  5K Mortgage Corporation is, and at all relevant times, has been a Corporation doing business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. 5K Mortgage Corporation engages in the business of a mortgage broker at 28 Sylvan Lane, Florence, MA 01062.  5K Mortgage Corporation is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage broker as required by Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner issued 5K Mortgage Corporation's initial license to engage in the business of a mortgage broker in Massachusetts on or about January 6, 2003.  Anthony J. Andersen is the president, director and fifty percent shareholder of 5K Mortgage Corporation.  Laura Andersen is the vice-president and fifty percent shareholder of 5K Mortgage Corporation. 	 (i) Felony Indictments/Convictions Affecting a Determination of the Licensee's Financial Responsibility, Character, Reputation, Integrity and General Fitness to Engage in the Licensed Business as to Anthony J. Andersen  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 states, in part, that: 	 Upon the filing of an application for a license, if the commissioner finds that the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity and general fitness of the applicant, and of the partners or members thereof if the applicant is a partnership or association, and of the officers, directors and principal employees if the applicant is a corporation, are such as to warrant belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest consistent with the purposes of this chapter, he shall thereupon issue the applicant a license to engage in the business of a mortgage lender or mortgage broker. If the commissioner shall not so find, he shall not issue a license and he shall notify the applicant of the denial.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 states, in part, that: 	 The commissioner may suspend or revoke any license issued pursuant to this chapter if said commissioner finds that: (i) the licensee has violated any provision of this chapter or any rule or regulation adopted hereunder, or any other law applicable to the conduct of its business; or (ii) any fact or condition exists which, if it had existed at the time of the original application for such license, would have warranted the commissioner in refusing to issue such license.  On February 16, 2007, a federal Grand Jury, impaneled in the United States District Court, Northern District of New York, returned an indictment against Mr. Andersen charging him with thirty felony counts, including: multiple counts of submitting false statements to a financial institution in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1014, 2; one count of bank fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1344(1), (2), 2; multiple counts of money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1956(a)(1)(A), 2, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1956(a)(1)(B)(i), 2 and 18 U.S.C. §§ 1957, 2; and one count of conspiracy to commit offense(s) against the United States, or to defraud the United States, or any agency thereof, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371.  On February 27, 2007, Mr. Andersen was arraigned pursuant to the criminal charges set forth in the February 16, 2007 indictment referenced above.  On June 22, 2007, a federal Grand Jury, impaneled in the United States District Court, Northern District of New York, returned a superseding indictment (the ""superseding indictment"") against Mr. Andersen and Laura Andersen, charging Mr. Andersen with the identical thirty felony counts as referenced in Paragraph 8 of this Temporary Order. The superseding indictment differed from the February 16, 2007 indictment in that Ms. Andersen was added as a defendant and charged with certain of the counts set forth in the February 16, 2007 indictment and with one additional felony count added to the indictment which pertained only to Ms. Andersen's alleged activities, as further described in Section (ii) of this Temporary Order.  On October 9, 2007, Mr. Andersen entered a Plea and Cooperation Agreement (""Mr. Andersen's Plea Agreement"") and changed his plea from ""Not Guilty"" to a plea of ""Guilty"" as to two of the counts set forth in the superseding indictment. Specifically, Mr. Andersen pled guilty to: one count of submitting false statements to a financial institution for the purpose of influencing the financial institution's action on loan applications in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1014, 2; and one count of money laundering involving monetary transactions over $10,000 in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1957, 2. Mr. Andersen's sentencing has been scheduled for February 11, 2008.  Pursuant to Mr. Andersen's Plea Agreement, Mr. Andersen admitted to the following facts which establish his guilt, as more fully set forth in Mr. Andersen's Plea Agreement, which is incorporated by reference and made a part of this Temporary Order as though fully set forth herein: 	 Mr. Andersen submitted to a financial institution a loan application and supporting documentation in the name of another individual for a loan for 555-557 2d Avenue, Troy, New York that contained materially false and fraudulent representations as to the identity of the borrower, the borrower's qualifications, the value and profitability of the properties, and the intended distribution of the loan proceeds.  Mr. Andersen obtained a loan for 3 Diack Place, Troy, New York from a financial institution by means of materially false representations as to the identity of the borrower, the borrower's qualifications, the value and profitability of the properties, and the intended distribution of the loan proceeds. Thereafter, knowing that the loan proceeds had been obtained by means of such false representations, Mr. Andersen caused approximately $141,402.18 from the loan proceeds to be transferred by wire from the closing attorney's bank account to Mr. Andersen's bank account.  (ii) Felony Indictments/Convictions Affecting a Determination of the Licensee's Financial Responsibility, Character, Reputation, Integrity and General Fitness to Engage in the Licensed Business as to Laura Andersen  On June 22, 2007, A federal Grand Jury, impaneled in the United States District Court, Northern District of New York, returned the superseding indictment referenced in Paragraph 10 of this Temporary Order against Mr. Andersen and Ms. Andersen, charging Ms. Andersen with multiple felony counts, including: two counts of aiding and abetting Mr. Andersen in the submission of false statements to a financial institution in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1014, 2; one count of aiding and abetting Mr. Andersen to commit bank fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1344(1), (2), 2; one count of making materially false, fraudulent statements in a matter within the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of the Treasury in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1001(a), 2; and one count of conspiracy to offense(s) against the United States, or to defraud the United States, or any agency thereof, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371.  On June 29, 2007, Ms. Andersen was arraigned pursuant to criminal charges set forth in the June 22, 2007 superseding indictment.  On October 9, 2007, Ms. Andersen entered a Plea and Cooperation Agreement (""Ms. Andersen's Plea Agreement"") and changed her plea from ""Not Guilty"" to a plea of ""Guilty,"" as to one of the counts set forth in the superseding indictment. Specifically, Ms. Andersen pled guilty to making false statements to federal law enforcement agencies, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1001(a), 2.  Pursuant to Ms. Andersen's Plea Agreement, Ms. Andersen admitted to the following facts which establish her guilt, as more fully set forth in Ms. Andersen's Plea Agreement, which is incorporated by reference and made a part of this Temporary Order as though fully set forth herein: 	 Ms. Andersen knowingly and willfully made materially false, fraudulent statements and representations in an interview conducted on February 14, 2006 by Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Criminal Investigation Division of the Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Department of the Treasury. To wit, Ms. Andersen falsely stated, among other things, that she never signed any type of mortgage-related paperwork on behalf of anyone else and that Mr. Andersen had never requested that she forge signatures or falsely complete any part of any mortgage application package.  (iii)Failure to Timely Notify the Division of the Occurrence of Significant Developments  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.12(2) states, in part, that: 	 A Licensee shall notify the Commissioner immediately, and in writing within five business days, of the occurrence of any of the following significant developments: . . . (b) Criminal felony indictment or conviction of any of the Licensee's officers, directors, principal stockholders, or affiliates.  On May 17, 2007, the Division received 5K Mortgage Corporation's 2007 Mortgage Broker License Renewal Application (""License Renewal Application""). Through the License Renewal Application, 5K Mortgage Corporation sought the renewal of its Massachusetts mortgage broker license for the twelve-month period ending May 31, 2008.  The License Renewal Application, which was signed under the pains and penalties of perjury by Mr. Andersen on May 16, 2007, included the following question, numbered (4)(A): ""In the past twelve months, has the licensee, or any control affiliate or control person: (1) been convicted of or plead guilty or nolo contendere (""no contest"") in a domestic, foreign, or military court to any felony? (2) been charged with any felony?"" The answer to the question provided by Mr. Andersen was ""Yes."" In explanation of the affirmative answer, Mr. Andersen stated that, in February, he had been charged with a felony in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York ""stemming from a real estate development firm I owned . . . back in 2001.""  By e-mail dated May 23, 2007, the Division requested further details regarding the felony charges referenced in the License Renewal Application.  In response to the Division's e-mail referenced above, Mr. Andersen's legal counsel, Dennis B. Schlenker, Esq. submitted a written statement dated May 30, 2007. Mr. Schlenker stated that the case was in the pre-trial stage. He also noted that, Mr. Andersen pled ""Not Guilty"" to the charges and intended to vigorously defend against the charges.  The Division refrained from taking any adverse regulatory action against 5K Mortgage and Mr. Andersen while the aforementioned criminal charges remained pending in order to afford Mr. Anderson the due process of law.  On or about November 19, 2007, a representative from the Division attempted to contact Mr. Andersen by telephone and left a voice mail message requesting an update on the case and any further information regarding the resolution of the charges against him.  By letter dated December 10, 2007, Mr. Andersen notified the Division of his Plea Agreement dated October 9, 2007, as described in Paragraph 11 of this Temporary Order.  At no time prior to the License Renewal Application did 5K Mortgage Corporation notify the Division of the felony indictment against Mr. Andersen dated February 16, 2007 or of the superseding indictment dated June 22, 2007.  5K Mortgage Corporation did not notify the Division of Mr. Andersen's Plea Agreement until approximately two months after the plea agreement was entered and only after such information was requested by the Division.  At no time did 5K Mortgage Corporation notify the Division of the June 22, 2007 superseding indictment against Ms. Andersen or of Ms. Andersen's Plea Agreement dated October 9, 2007. In fact, information obtained by the Division during the investigation of the charges entered against Mr. Andersen disclosed the existence of the superseding indictment entered, in part, against Ms. Andersen, vice-president and co-owner of 5K Mortgage. 	 B. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  By engaging in activities which resulted in Mr. Andersen's pleading guilty to the felony charges of making false statements for the purpose of influencing the action of a federally insured financial institution, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1014 and 2, and engaging and causing to be engaged in monetary transactions involving over $10,000 in property derived from specific unlawful activities, in violation of Title 18, United Stated Code, Sections 1957 and 2, Mr. Andersen has failed to demonstrate the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that 5K Mortgage Corporation will be operated honestly, fairly, soundly, and efficiently in the public interest as required by Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).  By engaging in activities which resulted in Ms. Andersen's pleading guilty to the felony charge of making false statements to federal law enforcement agencies, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001(a) and 2, Ms. Andersen has failed to demonstrate the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that 5K Mortgage Corporation will be operated honestly, fairly, soundly, and efficiently in the public interest as required by Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).  By failing to notify the Commissioner, in writing, within five business days that on February 16, 2007, Mr. Andersen, president and fifty percent shareholder of 5K Mortgage Corporation was indicted on 30 felony counts in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York, 5K Mortgage Corporation violated 209 CMR 42.12(2)(b).  By failing to notify the Commissioner, in writing, within five business days that on June 22, 2007, Mr. Andersen, president and fifty percent shareholder, and Ms. Andersen, vice president and fifty percent shareholder of 5K Mortgage Corporation were indicted on 31 felony counts, collectively, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York, 5K Mortgage Corporation violated 209 CMR 42.12(2)(b).  By failing to notify the Commissioner, in writing, within five business days that on October 9, 2007, Mr. Andersen and Ms. Andersen entered into separate ""Plea and Cooperation Agreements"" in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York, pursuant to which Mr. Andersen and Ms. Anderson pled guilty to federal felony offenses, 5K Mortgage Corporation violated 209 CMR 42.12(2)(b).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 27, had the foregoing existed at the time of 5K Mortgage Corporation's original mortgage broker license application, such conditions would have warranted a denial by the Commissioner of the license application and are grounds for the suspension or revocation of 5K Mortgage Corporation's mortgage broker license number MB2971 pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 27, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 5K Mortgage Corporation, a corporation owned and operated by Anthony J. Andersen and Laura Andersen, has engaged in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that the Corporation will not be operated honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage broker including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00 et seq.; and  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to 5K Mortgage Corporation.  C. ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that Anthony J. Andersen and Laura Andersen, individually, and 5K Mortgage Corporation, its officers, directors, employees, independent contractors, or agents operating on behalf of the Corporation, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of a mortgage broker, as defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Temporary Order. Therefore, Anthony J. Andersen and Laura Andersen, individually, and 5K Mortgage Corporation are ordered to immediately cease soliciting or accepting, either directly or indirectly, any residential mortgage loan applications from consumers for residential property located in Massachusetts.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, that 5K Mortgage Corporation shall immediately place any fees previously collected from Massachusetts consumers, relative to any pending mortgage loan applications accepted at any office location, into a separate escrow account, designated for such purpose and maintained at a federally insured bank.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that 5K Mortgage Corporation shall immediately place with one or more qualified broker(s) or lender(s), as appropriate based on the status of the application and with no loss to applicants, all of its pending Massachusetts residential mortgage loan applications. 5K Mortgage Corporation shall obtain the prior approval of the Commissioner before placing such applications to the qualified broker(s) or lender(s).  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that 5K Mortgage Corporation shall submit to the Commissioner a detailed record, prepared as of the date of submission, of all of the Corporation's pending residential mortgage loan applications on property located in Massachusetts. The records to be produced shall be submitted to the Commissioner within five (5) days of the effective date of this Temporary Order and shall include all information on file, regarding the Corporation's open application list, including but not necessarily limited to, the following: 	 All information on file as of the date of submission regarding 5K Mortgage Corporation's open application list, including but not limited to, the following: The names of all individuals from whom 5K Mortgage Corporation has accepted an application for a residential mortgage loan; the applicants' addresses and telephone numbers; the amount of all prepaid loan fees submitted by the customer; the amount of each loan; application status (i.e. filed, submitted to lenders, cleared to close, etc.); scheduled closing dates; rate lock status; and a list identifying the applicable broker(s) or lender(s) with whom the applicants' application was placed. The latter list should include telephone numbers of contact persons familiar with the Corporation's submitted loans.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that 5K Mortgage Corporation shall immediately secure all pending residential mortgage loan application files and shall make such files, in their entirety, available to the Commissioner upon request.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Temporary Order shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under General Laws chapter 30A.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such ORDER shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from 5K Mortgage Corporation within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this ORDER. If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this ORDER shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE LENDER AND  MORTGAGE BROKER  LICENSING  Docket No. 2008-006  FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  OlympiaWest Mortgage Group, LLC  Vienna, Virginia  Mortgage Lender and Mortgage Broker License No. MC5124  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that OlympiaWest Mortgage Group, LLC (""OlympiaWest"" or the ""Company"") located at 1950 Old Gallows Road, Vienna, Virginia, has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""Temporary Order"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  OlympiaWest is, and at all relevant times, has been a foreign company conducting business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. OlympiaWest's main office is located at 1950 Old Gallows Road, Vienna, Virginia.  OlympiaWest is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage lender and mortgage broker (collectively ""mortgage company"") under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage company license to OlympiaWest to engage in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts on or about February 25, 2005, with license no. MC3777. OlympiaWest failed to renew its mortgage company license no. MC3777, which expired on May 31, 2007. According to the Division's records, OlympiaWest was issued a new mortgage company license to engage in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker on or about December 4, 2007, with license no. MC5124.  According to the Division's records, Alfred John Luessenhop, Jr. is the chairman of the Company and holds a seventy-five percent ownership interest in OlympiaWest. Mark Fegani is the president and holds a twenty-five percent ownership interest in OlympiaWest.  On Wednesday, February 20, 2008, the Division received an e-mail from a licensed Massachusetts mortgage broker (""Mortgage Broker A"") stating that he had been informed that OlympiaWest was ceasing operations. Mortgage Broker A also stated that OlympiaWest was refusing to close and fund ""a couple of loans"" that he had placed with OlympiaWest.  Mortgage Broker A also submitted to the Division a copy of the e-mail that had been sent to Mortgage Broker A by a regional sales representative of OlympiaWest in which the sales representative indicated that OlympiaWest's wholesale division had ceased operations and would not fund one of the loans brokered by Mortgage Broker A.  On February 20, 2008, in order to investigate the conditions reported through the email referenced in the above Paragraph, the Division submitted a letter to OlympiaWest via email and facsimile requiring that, among other things, the Company submit a detailed record, prepared as of the close of business on February 19, 2008 (the ""pipeline report""), of all pending residential mortgage loan applications on properties located in each of the states in which OlympiaWest operated, including Massachusetts.  On Thursday, February 21, 2008, the Division was notified via an e-mail sent by another licensed Massachusetts mortgage broker, (""Mortgage Broker B""), that OlympiaWest had failed, or was about to fail, to timely disburse loan proceeds in at least three mortgage loan transactions involving residential property in Massachusetts relating to loan applications which Mortgage Broker B had placed with OlympiaWest.  According to Mortgage Broker B, three refinance loans (Loan #999080484 for $344,000 Loan #999908327 for $317,000; and Loan #999080268 for $355,600) that his firm had brokered to OlympiaWest, had closed on February 15, 2008, February 20, 2008, and February 21, 2008, respectively, and were scheduled to fund on February 21 2008 (Loan #999080484), and February 25, 2008 (Loan #999908327 and Loan #999080268), after the expiration of the loan rescission period.  Mortgage Broker B also notified the Division that a fourth loan, Loan #999080267, for $248,000, had been scheduled to close, but due to matters allegedly identified by OlympiaWest as technical problems, the closing package had never been forwarded to the settlement agent.  Mortgage Broker B forwarded to the Division a copy of an e-mail that had been sent by a regional sales representative of OlympiaWest to the Company's brokers on Wednesday, February 20, 2008, notifying the mortgage brokers that OlympiaWest had suspended all wholesale operations and all loans were no longer eligible for funding. The e-mail message stated in part, that, ""Effective 2/20/08, OMG Wholesale has suspended its operations. At present, the company's warehouse provider has provided written notice of its intention to exit the warehouse business and has suspended funding to the company effective February 20, 2008. Accordingly, all loans are no longer supported and no longer eligible for funding.""  ""OMG Wholesale"" refers to ""Olympia Mortgage Group Wholesale,"" which OlympiaWest has described to the Division as the wholesale division within OlympiaWest. Upon information and belief, it appears that Olympia Mortgage Group Wholesale's mortgage lending business in Massachusetts was at all times conducted under OlympiaWest's Massachusetts mortgage company license(s).  On Thursday, February 21, 2008, OlympiaWest submitted the pipeline report as requested by the Division via e-mail. The pipeline report reflected the purported status of all residential mortgage loan transactions from OlympiaWest's national operations, including all pending Massachusetts transactions.  The e-mail referenced in Paragraph 13 stated, in part, that: 	 ""Because of the current volatile mortgage environment, all loan approvals were expressly conditioned as follows â€˜LOAN APPROVAL SUBJECT TO ELIBILITY AND PRICING REVIEW PRIOR TO FUNDING. LOAN NO LONGER SUPPORTED WILL BE SUBJECT TO CHANGE OF PRICING AND/OR LOAN TERMS.' At present the company's warehouse provider has provided written notice of its intention to exit the warehouse business and has suspended funding to the company effective February 20, 2008. . . . OWMG is solvent and believes, acting on the condition set forth in all conditional approvals and other rights it may have, it has the right to suspend operations of OMG Wholesale.""  On Monday, February 25, 2008, the Division received notification from a third licensed Massachusetts mortgage broker (""Mortgage Broker C"") that one mortgage loan (Loan # 9999080678 for $150,000) that his firm had brokered to OlympiaWest had closed on February 15, 2008, had been scheduled to fund on February 21, 2008 after the expiration of the rescission period, and had failed to fund as of February 25, 2008.  On Monday, February 25, 2008, the Division became aware that certain information reflected on the pipeline report forwarded to the Division by OlympiaWest was inaccurate. According to the information reflected on the pipeline report, loan documents for Loan #999080268 were identified as having ""been ordered."" However, Mortgage Broker B indicated that the loan had, in fact, closed on February 20, 2008 and was scheduled to be funded on February 25, 2008. The pipeline report also indicated that loan documents for Loan #9990800267 were ""out."" However, Mortgage Broker B indicated that the closing package was not received by the settlement agent on or before the scheduled date of closing, due to ""technical problems.""  On February 26, 2008, the principals of OlympiaWest participated in a teleconference with representatives of the Division and representatives of other states (the ""February 26 teleconference""). During the teleconference, OlympiaWest's representatives indicated that the warehouse lender for the Company's wholesale operation had frozen the Company's line of credit because OlympiaWest had been required to repurchase a residential mortgage loan. The Company reported that it disputed its repurchase liability, claiming that a third party had underwritten the loan pursuant to its delegated underwriting authority and that OlympiaWest should not be obligated to repurchase the loan which had been characterized as fraudulent by the warehouse lender. This explanation for the termination or suspension of OlympiaWest's warehouse line of credit differs from the explanation provided to brokers as set forth in Paragraph 11, as well as from the explanation provided to the Division in the e-mail referenced in Paragraph 14.  During the February 26  th  teleconference, representatives of OlympiaWest stated that the Company was unwilling and/or unable to ensure that the consumers whose loan documents were executed and for which a loan closing had occurred but failed to fund as described in Paragraphs 9 and 15, would be restituted for the additional costs incurred as a result of OlympiaWest's failure to fulfill its obligation to fund the closed loans.  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.12A(16) states: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage lender to contract with a consumer through the underwriting and subsequent execution of mortgage loan closing documents and thereafter fail to fund the mortgage loan.  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.06(8) states: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a lender to fail to disburse funds in accordance with any commitment or agreement with the borrower.  Based upon information and belief, the loans referenced in Paragraphs 9 and 15 have not yet funded as of the effective date of this Temporary Order.  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.12A(17) states: 	 A violation of 209 CMR 42.12A shall constitute grounds for the issuance of a cease and desist order under M.G.L. c. 255E, § 7; shall constitute grounds for license suspension or revocation under M.G.L. c. 255E, § 6 and shall constitute grounds for an administrative fine or penalty under M.G.L. c. 255E, §§ 11 and 12.  By a letter to the Division dated February 26, 2008 from Alfred John Luessenhop, Jr., Principal of OlympiaWest, the Company indicated that it was surrendering its Massachusetts mortgage company license. The letter was sent via e-mail and by U.S. Mail. On February 28, 2008 the Division received the hard copy of the aforementioned letter which also included as an attachment the Company's original license certificate for its Massachusetts license MC5124.  The facts and circumstances set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 21, which precipitated the issuance of this Temporary Order, preceded OlympiaWest's attempt to surrender its Massachusetts mortgage company license as described in Paragraph 23. 	 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 24, by contracting with consumers for the refinance of mortgage loan(s) through the underwriting and subsequent execution of mortgage loan closing documents relating to Massachusetts residential property, and thereafter failing to fund the mortgage loan(s), OlympiaWest has violated the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(16) and the Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.06(8).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 24, by contracting to originate mortgage loan(s) that OlympiaWest did not have sufficient warehouse funds available to fund, or any other available alternative source of funds, OlympiaWest has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices in violation of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.04(2)(b)3.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 24, OlympiaWest has failed to demonstrate the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.03(2)(c) and 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 24, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 OlympiaWest has engaged in, is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that it is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. ; and  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to OlympiaWest.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 24, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of OlympiaWest original mortgage lender and mortgage broker license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 24 present sufficient grounds for the revocation OlympiaWest's mortgage lender and mortgage broker license pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.04(2)(b) and 209 CMR 42.07(2)(b). 	 ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that OlympiaWest and any and all officers, directors, employees, or agents operating on behalf of OlympiaWest, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker, as defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Temporary Order. Therefore, OlympiaWest is ordered to immediately cease soliciting or accepting, either directly or indirectly, any residential mortgage loan applications from consumers for residential property located in Massachusetts.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that OlympiaWest, shall immediately place any fees previously collected from Massachusetts consumers relative to any pending mortgage loan applications in a separate escrow account maintained at a federally insured bank.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that OlympiaWest shall immediately place with one or more qualified broker(s) or lender(s), with no loss to applicants, the following: (a) OlympiaWest's entire portfolio of Massachusetts residential mortgage loans which were closed by OlympiaWest, and remain unfunded as of the issuance of this Temporary Order; and (b) OlympiaWest's entire pending application list, as of February 19, 2008, of Massachusetts residential mortgage loans. It being understood that ""no loss to the applicant"" shall mean that any loan which was closed by OlympiaWest, as well as any application which was approved by OlympiaWest, shall be placed to a lender willing to fund, or close, the mortgage loan under the same terms and conditions extended by OlympiaWest. In the event that no such placement can be made, OlympiaWest shall either independently fund the mortgage loan under such terms and conditions or buy down the mortgage loan offered by the lender so that the applicant does not incur a loss as a result of such placement. OlympiaWest shall obtain the prior approval of the Commissioner before placing such applications to the qualified lender(s) or broker(s) as appropriate.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that in any instance in which OlympiaWest failed to fund a closed loan and in which the consumer, prior to the effective date of this Temporary Order, obtained funding through an alternate lender, OlympiaWest shall reimburse each consumer the amount necessary to put the consumer in the same position as if OlympiaWest had funded the mortgage loan under the terms and conditions agreed upon at the closing of the loan.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that OlympiaWest shall submit to the Commissioner a detailed record, prepared as of the date of submission, of all of the Company's pending residential mortgage loan applications on property located in Massachusetts. The records to be produced shall include all information on file regarding the Company's Massachusetts mortgage loan portfolio, including but not necessarily limited to, the following: 	 Within one (1) day of the effective date of this Temporary Order, OlympiaWest shall submit to the Commissioner all information on file as of the date of submission regarding the Company's portfolio of mortgage loans that were closed by OlympiaWest prior to the effective date of this Temporary Order, but remain as yet unfunded. Such information shall include, but is not limited to, the following: The names of all individuals from whom OlympiaWest processed an application and closed the residential mortgage loan, but failed to fund; the applicants' addresses and telephone numbers; the loan number; the amount of all prepaid loan fees submitted by the customer; the amount of each loan; the loan terms; the current funding status; the actual closing dates; the loan purpose (i.e. purchase or refinance); and identification of the applicable lender with whom each application will be placed. The record should include telephone numbers of contact persons at each lender who is familiar with the Company's submitted loans;  As soon as possible, but not later than five (5) days after the effective date of this Temporary Order, OlympiaWest shall submit to the Commissioner all information on file as of the date of submission regarding the Company's pipeline of pending mortgage loan applications including but not limited to, the following: The names of all individuals from whom OlympiaWest has accepted an application for a residential mortgage loan; the applicants' addresses and telephone numbers; the loan number; the amount of all prepaid loan fees submitted by the customer; rate lock status; the amount of each loan; application status (i.e. filed, submitted to lenders, cleared to close, etc.); loan terms, if approved; scheduled closing dates; the loan purpose (i.e. purchase or refinance); and identification of the applicable lender or broker with whom each application will be placed. The record should include telephone numbers of contact persons at each lender or broker who is familiar with the Company's submitted loans;  On the last business day of each subsequent week after the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, OlympiaWest shall provide the Commissioner with an updated, written status report of the mortgage loan applications identified above under subparagraphs 34(a) and 34(b). The form of the status report shall follow the format of the initial submission under subparagraphs 34(a) and 34(b) and shall indicate the final disposition of the loan application and include the final terms under which each approved loan is closed. The reporting requirement shall continue until each of the approved applications is placed with a lender and funded, funded by OlympiaWest, or withdrawn by the applicant(s); and  Within one (1) day of the effective date of this Temporary Order, OlympiaWest shall submit to the Commissioner OlympiaWest's balance sheet and year-to-date income statement, prepared as of the date of submission, and attested by a duly authorized officer of the Company. The balance sheet shall indicate OlympiaWest's cash position at each of its depository banks as well as OlympiaWest's bank account numbers.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that OlympiaWest shall immediately secure all pending mortgage loan application files and, to the extent that any original documents must be forwarded to the relevant mortgage lender(s) and or mortgage broker(s) pursuant to Paragraph 32 of this Temporary Order, a copy of such document, correspondence, or paper relating to the mortgage loan shall be retained in OlympiaWest's books and records and shall be available to the Commissioner, in their entirety, upon request.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Temporary Order shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 30A.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such Temporary Order shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from OlympiaWest within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this Temporary Order. If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this Temporary Order shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE BROKER  LICENSING  Docket No. 2008-010  FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  TEAM MORTGAGE, LLC  Plaistow, New Hampshire  Mortgage Broker License No. MB3359  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that TEAM MORTGAGE, LLC located at 13A Main Street, Plaistow, New Hampshire (""Team Mortgage"" or the ""Company""), has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""Temporary Order"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  Team Mortgage is, and at all relevant times has been, a foreign limited liability company conducting business in the Commonwealth. Team Mortgage's main office is located at 13A Main Street, Plaistow, New Hampshire.  Team Mortgage is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage broker license, license number MB3359, to Team Mortgage to engage in the business of a mortgage broker on or about March 30, 2004. License number MB3359 authorized Team Mortgage to conduct its mortgage broker business from the Company's main office located at 13A Main Street, Plaistow, New Hampshire.  At all relevant times, Joseph Davey has been the Principal and sole owner of Team Mortgage.  Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division is authorized to inspect the books, accounts, papers, records, and files of mortgage brokers transacting business in Massachusetts to determine compliance with the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E and any rule, or regulation issued thereunder, and with any law, rule, or regulation applicable to the conduct of the business of a mortgage broker.  On November 7, 2006, pursuant to the authority granted under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division commenced an examination/inspection of the books, accounts, papers, records, and files maintained by Team Mortgage to evaluate the Company's compliance with the laws, regulations, and regulatory bulletins applicable to the conduct of a mortgage broker business in Massachusetts (the ""2006 examination/inspection"").  The Division's Report of Examination/Inspection on Consumer Compliance (the ""Report""), which was issued to Team Mortgage on the effective date of this Temporary Order, presented the findings of the 2006 examination/inspection and alleged significant failures to comply with applicable state and federal laws, rules, regulations, and regulatory bulletins governing the conduct of those engaged in the business of a mortgage broker in Massachusetts. 	 A. Failure to Provide Notification of Regulatory Actions  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.12(1)(c) states, in part: 	 (1) A Licensee shall notify the Commissioner immediately, and in writing within one business day, of the occurrence of any of the following significant developments: . . . (c) Receiving notification of the institution of license denial, cease and desist, suspension or revocation procedures, or other formal or informal regulatory action, in any state against the Licensee, and the reasons thereof.  On April 4, 2007, the State of New Hampshire Banking Department (""New Hampshire Department"") issued an Order to Show Cause, Case No. 07-054, against Team Mortgage, which was amended pursuant to an Amendment to Order to Show Cause on April 13, 2007 (collectively, the ""Amended New Hampshire Order""). The Amended New Hampshire Order is incorporated by reference and made a part of this Temporary Order as though fully set forth herein.  The Amended New Hampshire Order referenced a prior Cease and Desist Order issued against the Company by the New Hampshire Department for the Company's operation of an unlicensed branch. The Amended New Hampshire Order does not reference the exact date of the aforementioned Cease and Desist Order, however the case number is listed as 06-275 and reference is made to a December 11, 2006 Consent Order resolving the pertinent issues.  The Statement of Allegations contained in the Amended New Hampshire Order set forth: 66 counts of ""illegal co-brokering;"" one count of ""failure to maintain security policy;"" 10 counts of ""failure to protect consumer information;"" 44 counts of ""failure to maintain records to enable compliance determination;"" and 13 counts of ""dishonest or unethical practices.""  Pursuant to a Notice of Hearing dated May 21, 2007, the New Hampshire Department scheduled an adjudicative proceeding to occur on June 18 and June 19, 2007 for the purpose of permitting the Company and Mr. Davey to show compliance with applicable New Hampshire statutes.  The adjudicative hearing referenced above was continued and ultimately began on December 11, 2007 and then continued for several days over the following three months thereafter. The hearing was eventually continued until March 11, 2008, upon joint motion of the parties.  Team Mortgage and Mr. Davey failed to appear in person or by representative at the March 11, 2008 adjudicative proceeding.  Based upon the parties' failure to appear, the New Hampshire Department issued a final Order for Default Judgment against Team Mortgage and Mr. Davey on March 26, 2008 which is incorporated by reference and made a part of this Temporary Order as though fully set forth herein. Pursuant to the Order for Default Judgment, Team Mortgage's New Hampshire mortgage broker license was revoked.  As of the effective date of this Temporary Order, the Division has not received notification from Team Mortgage of the occurrence of any of the events referenced above in Paragraphs 9 through 15 of this Temporary Order. 	 B. Unfair or Deceptive Acts Resulting in License Revocation in Another Jurisdiction  General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 states, in part, that, ""The commissioner may suspend or revoke any license issued pursuant to this chapter if said commissioner finds that: (ii) any fact or condition exists which, if it had existed at the time of the original application for such license, would have warranted the commissioner in refusing to issue such license.""  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.07(2)(b) states, in part, that: 	 The Commissioner may also deny such an application if the Applicant has: (4.) engaged in conduct which has resulted in the suspension or revocation of its license to engage in the business of a mortgage broker by the licensing authority of this or any other state.  By operation of New Hampshire law, Team Mortgage's default during the New Hampshire adjudicative proceeding referenced above constituted an admission of the facts alleged in the Amended Order to Show Cause, as more fully described in Paragraph 11 of this Temporary Order and resulted in the revocation of its New Hampshire mortgage broker license. 	 C. Engaging Unauthorized Individuals to Originate Mortgage Loans in Massachusetts  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2006 examination/inspection indicated that Team Mortgage, at all relevant times, retained unlicensed individuals, who were acting in the capacity of mortgage brokers and who were associated with and under the direction of the Company to conduct the mortgage broker business.  By prior published opinions, the Division has set forth the standards which an individual who is not employed by the licensed entity must satisfy, in advance, when seeking to operate in the capacity of a mortgage broker who is associated with and under the direction of a licensed mortgage broker under General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  Pursuant to the Division's published opinions, including but not limited to Opinion 97-222, the exemption from licensure is available only to individuals and not to a corporate entity. The relationship between the licensee and the individual must be exclusive and the individual must execute an Exemption Affidavit to that effect. The licensee must execute a Statement of Accountability for all activities of the individual associated with it. The individual seeking the exemption must be primarily engaged in the activity it is seeking to perform under the direction of a licensed mortgage broker.  By further published opinions, including but not limited to Opinion 97-061 the Division has established that ""this exemption would be effective provided that the Licensee completes and files with the Division a Statement of Accountability agreeing to take responsibility for the exempt individual's activities and the individual seeking the exemption completes and files the required Exemption Affidavit.""  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2006 examination/inspection revealed that Team Mortgage did not file the required Exemption Affidavits and Statements of Accountability for 25 independent contractors who were operating on behalf of the Company.  Because Team Mortgage had failed to file the aforementioned required Exemption Affidavits and Statements of Accountability, the Division was unable to determine if Team Mortgage had satisfied the qualifying standards for retaining individuals in the capacity of independent contractors associated with and under the direction of a licensed mortgage broker in accordance with the relevant opinions published by the Division.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2006 examination/inspection also revealed that 6 individuals originated loans in Massachusetts on behalf of Team Mortgage in their capacity as independent contractors, but were not engaged in the activity of a mortgage broker as their primary occupation, thereby failing to satisfy the qualifying standards for exemption from licensure. 	 D. Conducting Business with Unlicensed Entities  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.06(9) states: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to conduct business with a person which should be licensed under M.G.L. c. 255E, and which it knows or should know is an unlicensed mortgage broker or lender.  By prior published opinions, the Division has set forth the standards which an individual must satisfy, in advance, when seeking to operate in the capacity of an independent contractor associated with a licensed mortgage broker under General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. The Division's published opinions have consistently held that the exemption from licensure referenced herein is available exclusively to individuals engaging in the licensed business in the name of the licensee and is not available to an independent corporation, partnership, association, or other legal entity that is separate and distinct from the legal entity in whose name the license was issued.  Books and records reviewed during the 2006 examination/inspection revealed that Team Mortgage compensated an unlicensed business entity for loans originated through Team Mortgage, as specifically described in the Report. 	 E. Payment of Referral Fees  The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act's, (""RESPA"") implementing regulation, 24 CFR 3500.14(b) states in part: 	 No person shall give . . . any fee, kickback or other thing of value pursuant to any agreement or understanding, oral or otherwise, that business incident to or part of a settlement service involving a federally related mortgage loan shall be referred to any person. Any referral of a settlement service is not a compensable service, except as set forth in '3500.14(g)(1). A company may not pay any other company or the employees of any other company for the referral of settlement service business.  The RESPA implementing regulation, 24 CFR 3500.14(c) states, in part: 	 No person shall give . . . any portion, split, or percentage of any charge made or received for the rendering of a settlement service in connection with a transaction involving a federally related mortgage loan other than for services actually performed. A charge by a person for which no or nominal services are performed or for which duplicative fees are charged is an unearned fee and violates this section.  Books and records reviewed during the 2006 examination/inspection revealed that during the period from April through September of 2006, Team Mortgage compensated the unlicensed individual identified in the Report in excess of $94,200 for services provided in connection with mortgage loans originated by the Company.  Upon inquiry, Mr. Davey did not clarify the exact nature of the services performed, but confirmed that the individual did not perform minimum services required to justify payment of a fee as set forth by applicable interpretive guidance by the government agency responsible for interpreting RESPA.  The Division's examiners determined that Team Mortgage calculated the compensation paid to the individual based upon a percentage of the commission that Team Mortgage received from the lender for each applicable loan. 	 F. Undisclosed Fees  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 183, section 63 states, in part: 	 A mortgagee, or a mortgage lender or mortgage broker as defined in section one of chapter two hundred and fifty-five E, shall not charge a loan fee, finder's fee, points, so-called, or similar fees in a mortgage transaction involving residential property located in the commonwealth of four or less units and occupied in whole or in part by the mortgagor, except to the extent that such fees or points have been previously disclosed to the mortgagor in writing, which disclosure may be in the form required by section seventeen D of chapter one hundred and eighty-four, or such other form which discloses said fees or points. A mortgagor shall not be obligated to pay fees or points which have not been previously disclosed as required herein.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2006 examination/inspection indicate, as more fully described in the Report, that the Company engaged in a pattern or practice of understatements or omissions of the fees charged to consumers by Team Mortgage.  The Company's books and records indicate that processing fees, application fees, loan fees, or similar fees (collectively, ""broker fees"") were collected at the loan closing in amounts which Team Mortgage's books and records failed to illustrate had been fully and accurately disclosed to consumers, in writing, to the extent charged at closing, if at all. 	 G. Failure to Properly Maintain Books and Records  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.09(1) states, in part, that: 	 Each Licensee shall keep and use its books, records and accounts in a manner which will allow the Commissioner to determine whether the Licensee is complying with the provisions of M.G.L. c. 255E and applicable state and federal laws and regulations. Each Licensee shall comply with the provisions of 209 CMR 48.00...  (b)The mortgage broker ' shall retain for a minimum of three years after a mortgage loan is made the following: the original loan origination and compensation agreement as set out in 209 CMR 42.16; a copy of the settlement statement; an account of fees received in connection with the loan; correspondence; papers or records relating to the loan; and such other documents as the Commissioner may require.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2006 examination/inspection indicated that Team Mortgage failed to retain sufficient documentation to enable the Commissioner to determine whether the Company was complying with certain laws and regulations governing mortgage brokers in Massachusetts. Specifically, Team Mortgage failed to retain nine (9) of the closed loan files that the Division's examiners requested for review and failed to retain signed copies of the relevant Loan Origination and Compensation Agreement.  Additionally, the Division's regulation 209 CMR 48.04 states, in part: 	 Each Licensee shall keep and use its books, records, and accounts within the Commonwealth, except, however, that with the prior approval by the Commissioner of a written plan, a Licensee may keep such books, records, and accounts at a location, or locations, outside of the Commonwealth.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 48.06 states, in part, that: 	 A Licensee may amend its written plan from time to time and such amendment shall not be effective until approved by the Commissioner.  According to Division records, Team Mortgage received approval from the Division to maintain its books and records at 13A Main Street, Plaistow, New Hampshire.  The 2006 examination/inspection revealed that Team Mortgage maintains its loan files at an off-site location in Atkinson, New Hampshire. Team Mortgage neither filed for nor received approval from the Division to maintain its records at that location. 	 H. Issuance of Mortgage Loan Rate Lock Agreements  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(3) states, in part: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker to issue a mortgage loan rate lock commitment on its own behalf or on behalf of a mortgage lender, or to imply to a consumer that it can lock a rate on behalf of the consumer. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit a mortgage broker from taking a rate lock commitment fee for transmittal to a mortgage lender prior to the issuance by the mortgage lender of a commitment or approval, provided that prior to the taking of a rate lock commitment fee:  ..................................................  (b) the rate lock commitment fee is made payable by the consumer to the mortgage lender which intends to make the loan. A mortgage broker may only take a rate lock commitment fee for transmittal to the mortgage lender which intends to make the loan. Nothing herein shall prohibit a mortgage broker from negotiating the terms or conditions of a mortgage loan, including the interest rate, on behalf of a consumer. A mortgage broker may also use such forms or other evidence as desired to allow a consumer to indicate a preference to enter into a mortgage rate lock commitment with a mortgage lender. However, any such forms or evidence must clearly and conspicuously contain the following statement: ""This is a request, not a commitment, to lock your interest rate with a mortgage lender"".  The 2006 examination/inspection revealed that Team Mortgage provided consumers with the following forms that state or imply that Team Mortgage can lock a mortgage rate on behalf of the consumer: ""Acknowledgment of Rate Lock-In or Float Option;"" and ""Rate Options-Finance Agreement.""  The forms referenced in the preceding paragraph did not contain the required language, ""This is a request, not a commitment, to lock your interest rate with a mortgage lender."" 	 I. Providing Mortgage Lender Disclosures to Consumers  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2006 examination/inspection indicate that Team Mortgage routinely provided several mortgage lender disclosures to consumers.  The mortgage lender disclosures include, but are not limited to, Equal Credit Opportunity Notices, Servicing Disclosure Statements, and Notice to Applicant of Right to Receive Copy of Appraisal Report.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 183, section 28C(a) states in part: 	 A lender shall not knowingly make a home loan if the home loan pays off all or part of an existing home loan that was consummated within the prior 60 months or other debt of the borrower, unless the refinancing is in the borrower's interest. The ""borrower's interest"" shall be narrowly construed, and the burden is upon the lender to determine that the refinancing is in the borrower's interest.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 53.07(1)(b) states in part: 	 A lender may request that a borrower acknowledge receipt of such a worksheet or other documentation; provided, however, a lender shall not shift the burden to the borrower to demonstrate that a home loan is in the borrowers' interest.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2006 examination/inspection revealed that Team Mortgage provided consumers with ""Determination and Documentation of Borrower's Interest"" and ""Borrower's Attestation of Tangible Benefit"" worksheets (""Worksheets""); documents that only mortgage lenders are authorized to provide to borrowers.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2006 examination/inspection also revealed that the Worksheets provided to the applicable consumers shifted the burden to the consumers to demonstrate that the loan was in the borrowers' interest and to their benefit. 	 J. Misleading Statements  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1) states, in part: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to make any representation or statement of fact if the representation or statement is false or misleading, or has the tendency or capacity to be misleading.  Books and records reviewed during the 2006 examination revealed that Team Mortgage provided applicants with a Borrower's Certification and Authorization Form that contained language that was false or misleading or had the tendency or capacity to be false or misleading. Specifically, the Borrower's Certification and Authorization Form contained language which would present the appearance that Team Mortgage, a mortgage broker, was approving or funding the mortgage loan. 	 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 54, Team Mortgage has failed to demonstrate the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 54, Team Mortgage failed to notify the Commissioner of the multiple regulatory actions taken against the Company by the New Hampshire Banking Department, in violation of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12(1)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 54, the admitted facts presented by the New Hampshire Banking Department relative to Team Mortgage, as specifically set forth in Paragraph 11 of this Temporary Order, fail to support a finding that Team Mortgage has maintained the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 54, Team Mortgage has solicited or accepted residential mortgage loan applications for property located in Massachusetts from individuals engaging in the activity of a mortgage broker who were not employed by the Company and who otherwise failed to qualify for an exemption from licensure as set forth by the Division by prior published opinions, including without limitation Opinions 96-221, 97-061, and 97-222 in violation of General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 54, Team Mortgage compensated unlicensed entities for loans originated through the Company in violation of the Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.06(9).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 54, Team Mortgage compensated an individual through payments of unlawful referral fees, in apparent violation of the RESPA implementing regulation 24 CFR 3500.14(b).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 54, by charging loan fees, points, or similar fees in residential mortgage loan transactions in the Commonwealth, without disclosing such fees or points to the mortgagor, in writing, prior to the closing of the loan, Team Mortgage has violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 183, section 63.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 54, by failing to keep and use its books and records in a manner which would allow the Commissioner to determine whether the Company was complying with state and federal laws and regulations applicable to mortgage brokers, Team Mortgage has violated the Division's regulations 209 CMR 42.09(1) and 209 CMR 48.03.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 54, Team Mortgage provided consumers with written documentation that stated or implied that the Company was able to lock mortgage rates on behalf of the consumer, in violation of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(3).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 54, by providing disclosures to consumers that only lenders are authorized to provide Team Mortgage has exceeded its authority as a mortgage broker in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 54, Team Mortgage provided disclosures to consumers that contained language that was false or misleading or had the tendency or capacity to be false or misleading, in violation of the Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 54, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 Team Mortgage has engaged in, is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that it is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage broker including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. ; and  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to Team Mortgage.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 54, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of Team Mortgage's original mortgage broker license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 54 present sufficient grounds for the revocation of Team Mortgage's mortgage broker license pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.07(2)(b) and 42.12A(17). 	 ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that Team Mortgage and any and all officers, directors, employees, independent contractors, or agents operating on behalf of Team Mortgage, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of a mortgage broker, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Temporary Order.

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that within sixty (60) days of the effective date of this Temporary Order, the Company shall cause to be made a review of all Massachusetts residential mortgage loans originated by Team Mortgage since March 30, 2004 and shall identify all mortgage loan transactions in which the amount actually paid by the consumer as a loan fee, mortgage broker fee, application fee, or similar fee, as recorded on the settlement agreement, exceeded the amount disclosed to the consumer, in writing, for such fees prior to closing; 	 In each mortgage loan transaction identified pursuant to Paragraph [], Team Mortgage shall reimburse the consumer the difference between the actual charge assessed to the individual consumer as a loan fee, mortgage broker fee, processing fee, or similar fee and the amount disclosed in writing for such fees prior to closing;  Within sixty (60) days of the effective date of this Temporary Order, Team Mortgage shall submit to the Commissioner a list of all borrowers identified pursuant to the above described review of residential mortgage loan transactions to whom a reimbursement is owed by the Company in accordance with this Paragraph of the Temporary Order; and  Within ninety (90) days of the effective date of this Temporary Order, Team Mortgage shall submit evidence of all reimbursements issued to consumers pursuant to this Paragraph of the Temporary Order, including the consumers' names, the dates the loans closed, check numbers, and the amount of the reimbursements.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE LENDER AND  MORTGAGE BROKER  LICENSING  Docket No. 2008-011  FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  FIDELITY HOME MORTGAGE CORPORATION  d/b/a MARYLAND FIDELITY HOME  Baltimore, Maryland  Mortgage Lender and Mortgage Broker License No(s): MC4719; MC5037  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that FIDELITY HOME MORTGAGE CORPORATION d/b/a MARYLAND FIDELITY HOME (""Fidelity Home Mortgage"" or the ""Corporation""), located at 1012 North Point Road, Baltimore, Maryland has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""Temporary Order"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  Fidelity Home Mortgage is, and at all relevant times has been, a foreign corporation conducting business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Fidelity Home Mortgage's main office is located at 1012 North Point Road, Baltimore, Maryland.  Fidelity Home Mortgage is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage lender and mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage company license to Fidelity Home Mortgage to engage in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts on or about April 2, 2007, with license number MC4719. License number MC4719 authorized Fidelity Home Mortgage to conduct the mortgage company business from the Corporation's main office located at 1012 North Point Road, Baltimore, Maryland.  Fidelity Home Mortgage maintains an additional licensed office location at 730 North Broad Street, Suite 100, Woodbury, New Jersey, from which the Corporation conducts its mortgage lender and mortgage broker business. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner issued a mortgage company license, license number MC5037, to Fidelity Mortgage for that location on or about July 27, 2007.  According to the Division's records, Stilianos Mavroulis is the president, and sole shareholder of Fidelity Home Mortgage.  According to the Division's records, Kyriakos Mavroulis serves as the vice president of Fidelity Home Mortgage.  On February 28, 2008, a federal Grand Jury, impaneled in the United States District Court, Maryland District, returned an indictment against Stilianos Mavroulis charging him with five felony counts, including: one count of conspiracy to commit offense(s) against the United States, or to defraud the United States, or any agency thereof, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §371 and four counts of making and subscribing to false tax returns, in violation of 26 U.S.C §7206(1).  On February 28, 2008, a federal Grand Jury, impaneled in the United States District Court, Maryland District, returned an indictment against Kyriakos Mavroulis charging him with two felony counts including: one count one count of conspiracy to commit offense(s) against the United States, or to defraud the United States, or any agency thereof, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §371 and one count of making and subscribing to false tax returns, in violation of 26 U.S.C §7206(1).  The indictment alleged that that for approximately six years between 1998 and 2004, Stilianos Mavroulis and Kyriakos Mavroulis, who were responsible for managing Fidelity Home Mortgage's accounting department, allegedly ""knowingly and intentionally combine[d], conspire[d], confederate[d] and agree[d] together and with one another to defraud the United States.""  The indictment further alleged that between 1998 and 2003, Stilianos Mavroulis and Kyriakos Mavroulis diverted at least $1.9 million from Fidelity Home Mortgage's funds to pay for personal family expenses. As a result, the Mavroulis family underpaid their individual income taxes by ""at least $540,000.""  The indictment alleged that both Stilianos and Kyriakos Mavroulis caused Fidelity Home Mortgage to pay the Mavroulis children, who worked at Fidelity Home Mortgage ""under the table in order to permit them to avoid paying income taxes on income received"" from the Corporation.  A press release issued on February 28, 2008, by the United States Attorney's Office, in Baltimore, Maryland (""press release""), alleged that Stilianos and Kyriakos Mavroulis used Fidelity Home Mortgage's funds to ""make personal investments in the stock market, including $100,000 to fund, among other things, personal investments through E-Trade; finance the operations of Fidelity Promotions, a company [Stilianos Mavroulis] owned and established in connection with a personal musical venture in Greece; and pay airfare and hotels in traveling to Greece.""  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.12(2) states, in part, that: 	 A Licensee shall notify the Commissioner immediately, and in writing within five business days, of the occurrence of any of the following significant developments: . . . (b) Criminal felony indictment or conviction of any of the Licensee's officers, directors, principal stockholders, or affiliates.  As of the effective date of this Temporary Order, the Division has not received notification from Fidelity Home Mortgage of the occurrence of the events referenced above in Paragraph 7 through 12, inclusive, of this Temporary Order.  By a letter dated March 27, 2008, which was received by the Division on or around March 28, 2008, Fidelity Home Mortgage filed a written notice with the Division proposing changes among the ownership and officers of Fidelity Home Mortgage. The request indicated that as of April 1, 2008, Stilianos Mavroulis would be transferring the ownership of the Corporation, in its entirety, to his spouse on April 1, 2008.  Fidelity Home Mortgage's March 27  th  letter did not specifically address, what changes, if any, would occur relative to Kyriakos Mavroulis' status with Fidelity Home Mortgage although he was not included in the proposed designation of officers and directors which was to take effect as of April 1, 2008.  As of the effective date of this Temporary Order, the Division has neither approved nor denied the proposed changes in the ownership and officers of Fidelity Home Mortgage.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12(3)(a) states: 	 (a) 15 days prior to any proposed change in control in the ownership of a Licensee, or among the officers, partners or directors of a Licensee, a notice shall forthwith be filed with the Commissioner who may thereupon cause such investigation to be made as he deems necessary, as if it were a new license. In the case of a corporation, control is defined as a change of ownership by a person or group acting in concert to acquire ten percent of the stock, or the ability of a person or group acting in concert to elect a majority of the directors or otherwise effect a change in policy of the corporation.  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 18, by failing to notify the Commissioner, in writing, within five business days that on February 28, 2008, Stilianos Mavroulis, president and sole shareholder of Fidelity Home Mortgage was indicted on five felony counts in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, Fidelity Home Mortgage violated 209 CMR 42.12(2)(b).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 18, by failing to notify the Commissioner, in writing, within five business days that on February 28, 2008, Kyriakos Mavroulis, vice president of Fidelity Home Mortgage was indicted on two felony counts in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, Fidelity Home Mortgage violated 209 CMR 42.12(2)(b).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 18, by failing to notify the Commissioner, in writing, of a change in ownership fifteen days prior to the change, Fidelity Home Mortgage violated 209 CMR 42.12(3)(a).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 18, Fidelity Home Mortgage has failed to demonstrate the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.03(2)(c) and 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 18, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 Fidelity Home Mortgage, a Corporation owned by Stilianos Mavroulis during all relevant times is engaging in, has engaged in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that it is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. ; and  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to Fidelity Home Mortgage.  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that Fidelity Home Mortgage and any and all, officers, directors, employees, independent contractors, or agents operating on behalf of Fidelity Home Mortgage, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker, as defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Temporary Order. Therefore, Fidelity Home Mortgage is ordered to immediately cease soliciting or accepting, either directly or indirectly, any residential mortgage loan applications from consumers for residential property located in Massachusetts.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Fidelity Home Mortgage shall immediately place with one or more qualified broker(s) or lender(s), as appropriate based on the status of the application and with no loss to applicants, all of its pending Massachusetts residential mortgage loan applications. Fidelity Home Mortgage shall obtain the prior approval of the Commissioner before placing such applications to the qualified broker(s) or lender(s).  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Fidelity Home Mortgage shall submit to the Commissioner a detailed record, prepared as of the date of submission, of all of the Corporation's pending residential mortgage loan applications on property located in Massachusetts. The records to be produced shall be submitted to the Commissioner within five (5) days of the effective date of this Temporary Order and shall include all information on file, regarding the Corporation's open application list, including but not necessarily limited to, the following: 	 All information on file as of the date of submission regarding Fidelity Home Mortgage's open application list, including but not limited to, the following: The names of all individuals from whom Fidelity Home Mortgage has accepted an application for a residential mortgage loan; an indication of whether Fidelity Home Mortgage accepted the application in its capacity as a mortgage lender or mortgage broker in the transaction; the applicants' addresses and telephone numbers; the amount of all prepaid loan fees submitted by the customer; the amount of each loan; application status (i.e. filed, submitted to lenders, cleared to close, etc.); scheduled closing dates; rate lock status; and a list identifying the applicable broker(s) or lender(s) with whom the applicants' application was placed. The latter list should include telephone numbers of contact persons familiar with the Corporation's submitted loans.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Fidelity Home Mortgage shall immediately secure all pending residential mortgage loan application files and shall make such files, in their entirety, available to the Commissioner upon request.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Temporary Order shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under General Laws chapter 30A.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such Temporary Order shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from Fidelity Home Mortgage within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this Temporary Order. If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this Temporary Order shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE  The Division, through the Commissioner, is an agency of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts with jurisdiction over matters relating to the licensing and operation of those engaged in the business of a mortgage broker pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2 and Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8.  At all relevant times, Alpine Financial has been engaged in the business of a mortgage broker of residential property (""Residential property"" means real property located in the Commonwealth having thereon a dwelling house with accommodations for four or less separate households and occupied, or to be occupied, in whole or in part by the obligor on the mortgage debt pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1.) in Massachusetts. 	 RESPONDENT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  Alpine Financial is, and at all relevant times has been, a Massachusetts limited liability company doing business in the Commonwealth. Alpine Financial's main office is located at 714B Southbridge Street, Auburn, Massachusetts.  Alpine Financial is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner issued mortgage broker license number MB3286 to Alpine Financial to engage in the business of a mortgage broker at 714B Southbridge Street, Auburn, Massachusetts on January 28, 2004.  Alpine Financial maintains additional office locations from which the Corporation conducts the mortgage broker business. According to records maintained on file with the Division, Alpine Financial currently possesses two (2) additional mortgage broker licenses from the Commissioner for locations operated in Marlborough and Boston, Massachusetts. 	 REGULATORY BACKGROUND  Mortgage brokers in Massachusetts are licensed and regulated under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, which is administered and enforced by the Commissioner. Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division is authorized to inspect the books, accounts, papers, records, and files of mortgage brokers transacting business in Massachusetts to determine compliance with the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E or any rule, or regulation issued thereunder, and with any law, rule, or regulation applicable to the conduct of the business of a mortgage broker.  On November 30, 2006, pursuant to the authority granted under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division commenced an examination/inspection of the books, accounts, papers, records, and files maintained by Alpine Financial to evaluate the Company's compliance with the laws, regulations, and regulatory bulletins applicable to the conduct of a mortgage broker business in Massachusetts (the ""2006 examination/inspection"").  The Report of Examination/Inspection (the ""Report"") prepared as of November 30, 2006 has been issued as of the effective date of this Order and Notice and was mailed to the Company's licensed address of record at 714b Southbridge Street, Auburn, MA 01501. 	 A. Unfair or Deceptive Practices  During the 2006 examination/inspection, the Division discovered that Alpine Financial had submitted to lenders Uniform Residential Loan Applications (""1003 Form"") in which the applicants' stated gross monthly income differed significantly from the gross income as set forth in other pertinent documentation which Alpine Financial had in its possession. Moreover, said books and records reviewed by the Division's examiner contained multiple 1003 Forms for each loan file that reflected different gross monthly base employment incomes. Examples include, but are not limited to the following documents, as summarized below: 	 Loan #0508037607 and #0508037608. Redacted copies of the documents are attached hereto as Exhibit 1 and are incorporated by reference. 		 A first mortgage loan application signed and dated on July 18, 2006, by the applicant, indicated that the gross monthly base employment income of the applicant was $2,916, with net rental income of $1,350, and other (social security) income of $600, for a total of $4,866, or $58,632 annually.  The second mortgage loan application signed and dated on July 18, 2005, indicated that the gross monthly base employment income was $5,500, net rental income of $1,500, and other (social security) income of $600, for a total of $7,600, or $91,200 annually.  A loan application signed at settlement on August 26, 2005 indicated that the gross monthly base employment income was $6,700, with net rental income of $0, and other income of $0, for an annual total of $80,400.  An incomplete and undated handwritten loan application indicated that the gross monthly base employment income for the aforementioned applicant, who was on this particular application listed as a co-applicant, was $12.64 per hour for 40 hours ($2,190.93 per month), with bonus (overtime) income of $14.14 per hour for 16 hours ($980.37 per month), and other (social security) income of $600, for a total of $3,771.30 per month, or $45,255.60 annually.  Employment payment stubs for the applicant indicated that, under optimal circumstances (i.e. maximum overtime pay), the applicant's gross monthly base employment income would amount to $45,624.28 annually.  The discrepancy in income reveals an overstatement of the applicant's gross annual income of approximately $34,776.  Loan #326453 and #326455. Redacted copies of the documents are attached hereto as Exhibit 2 and are incorporated by reference. 		 The Uniform Underwriting and Transmittal Form from the original application indicated the applicant's gross monthly income as $2,340, other income as $1,890, and positive cash flow on property of $2,426, totaling $6,656 per month, or $79,872 annually.  The Internal Loan Approval form generated by the lender based on the Company's submission of the initial application reflected gross monthly base employment income of $4,343.24, other income of $529.33, and net rental of $1,313.50, totaling $6,186.07 per month, or $74,232.84 annually.  Gross monthly base employment income reported on the first and second mortgage loan applications signed at settlement on February 13, 2006, was $5,500, with net rental income of $1,300, and other income of $530, totaling $7,330, or $87,960 annually.  W-2 forms (retained in the loan file) for the years ending 2003 and 2004 report wages of $18,419.11 and $18,434.29, from one employer, and $6,674.01 and $6,352.00, from a second employer. Also retained in the loan files were pay stubs that reflect year-to-date gross earnings of $17,207.32 from the first employer as of November 17, 2005. Year-to-date gross earnings from the second employer as of December 14, 2005, were $5,393.00.  The applicant's income as set forth in the W-2 forms reflects a total annual income of approximately $35,000.00. Rental income based on the lease agreement would amount to approximately $1500.00 per month ($18,000.00 annually). Gross annual income would therefore amount to approximately $53,000.00.  The discrepancy in income reveals an overstatement of the applicant's gross annual income of approximately $34,960.  Loan #161041666 and #161041668. Redacted copies of the documents are attached hereto as Exhibit 3 and are incorporated by reference. 		 The gross monthly base employment income reported on the full-documentation first mortgage loan application signed and dated April 15, 2005, was $2,744.39, or $32,932.68 annually.  On the loan application for the stated-income second mortgage application, signed and dated on April 15, 2007, the gross monthly base employment income was $4,200.00, or $50,400.00 annually.  The W-2 forms, retained in the loan file, for the years ending 2003 and 2004 reported wages of $33,322.18 and $32,543.12 respectively.  Pay stubs, retained in the loan file reflected year-to-date gross earnings of $8,740.00 as of March 31, 2005; extrapolated earnings for the remainder of the year aggregate expected gross annual income of $34,960.00.  The review of the loan file revealed that the annual base income on the second loan application was overstated by approximately $15,400.00.  By letter to the Division dated August 1, 2007, Jason Cabana, owner of Alpine Financial, attempted to explain the discrepancies noted in certain of the loan files referenced in Paragraph 11 of this Order and Notice. A copy of the letter is enclosed as Exhibit 4. According to the letter: 	 The loan application(s) referenced in Paragraph 11(a) of the Order and Notice was originally submitted with a co-borrower named on the application. The lender rejected the original application because one of the co-borrowers had an unsatisfactory credit history. The lender knew that both individuals would be living in the home and advised Alpine Financial to increase the borrower's income and remove the co-borrower from the loan.  The loan application(s) referenced in Paragraph 11(b) of the Order and Notice was originally submitted as a full documentation application with a co-borrower named on the application. The lender would not accept the application with one of the co-borrowers on the loan because of the co-borrower's unsatisfactory credit history. According to the letter, ""[t]he lender's approval conditions states [sic] specifically using [the co-borrower's] W-2 income."" Alpine Financial then added the other individual's income to the borrower of record's income. Alpine Financial also added income from the borrower's second job and rental income that had not been included in the initial application.  Relative to the loan application(s) referenced in Paragraph 11(c) of the Order and Notice, the income listed on the application for the second mortgage ""was never updated on the 1003 to reflect final underwriter's approval.""  Alpine Financial assisted in placing each of the applicants referenced in Paragraph 11 of this Order and Notice into stated income loan products when the mortgage loan application was placed with the relevant mortgage lender or financial institution.  Alpine Financial knew or should have known that the incomes and/or liabilities stated in the 1003 Forms for the above referenced files were inaccurate or not reasonably reliable.  Alpine Financial knew or should have known that the income and/or liability information reported on the above referenced 1003 Forms, and placed by Alpine Financial, would be relied upon in underwriting the mortgage loan by the mortgage lender or financial institution to which the mortgage loan applications were brokered by Alpine Financial.  Alpine Financial knew or should have known that its participation in a pattern or practice of assisting in obtaining mortgage loans based upon inaccurate borrower income, employment and/or liability information would be detrimental to the public interest. 	 B. Undisclosed Fees  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 183, section 63 states, in pertinent part: 	 A mortgagee, or a mortgage lender or mortgage broker as defined in section one of chapter two hundred and fifty-five E, shall not charge a loan fee, finder's fee, points, so-called, or similar fees in a mortgage transaction involving residential property located in the commonwealth of four or less units and occupied in whole or in part by the mortgagor, except to the extent that such fees or points have been previously disclosed to the mortgagor in writing, which disclosure may be in the form required by section seventeen D of chapter one hundred and eighty-four, or such other form which discloses said fees or points. A mortgagor shall not be obligated to pay fees or points which have not been previously disclosed as required herein.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2006 examination/inspection indicate that the Company engaged in a pattern or practice of understatements or omissions regarding the fees charged to consumers by Alpine Financial.  The Company's books and records indicate that processing fees, and application fees (collectively, ""broker fees"") were collected at the loan closing in amounts which were not accurately disclosed to consumers, in writing, to the extent charged at closing, if at all. For details, see Exhibit 5 which is attached and incorporated herein by reference. 	 C. Conducting Business with Unlicensed Entities  The Attorney General's Regulation 940 CMR 8.06(9) states: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to conduct business with a person which should be licensed under M.G.L. c. 255E, and which it knows or should know is an unlicensed mortgage broker or lender.  By prior published opinions, the Division has set forth the standards which an individual must satisfy, in advance, when seeking to operate in the capacity of an independent contractor associated with a licensed mortgage broker or mortgage lender under General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. The Division's published opinions have consistently held that the exemption from licensure referenced herein is available exclusively to individuals engaging in the licensed business in the name of the licensee and is not available to an independent corporation, partnership, association, or other legal entity that is separate and distinct from the legal entity in whose name the license was issued.  Books and records reviewed during the 2006 examination/inspection revealed that Alpine Financial compensated certain unlicensed business entities for loans originated through Alpine Financial, as specifically described in the Report. 	 D. Engaging Unauthorized Individuals to Originate Mortgage Loans in Massachusetts  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2006 examination/inspection indicate that Alpine Financial, at all relevant times, retained numerous unlicensed individuals, who were acting in the capacity of mortgage brokers and who were associated with and under the direction of the Company to conduct the mortgage broker business.  By prior published opinions, the Division has set forth the standards which an unlicensed individual must satisfy, in advance, when seeking to operate in the capacity of a mortgage broker who is associated with and under the direction of a licensed mortgage broker under General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  Pursuant to the Division's published Opinion 97-222, the position of the Division of Banks is that exemption from licensure is available only to individuals and not to a corporate entity. The relationship between the licensee and the individual must be exclusive and the individual must execute an Exemption Affidavit to that effect. The licensee must execute a Statement of Accountability for all activities of the individual associated with it. The individual seeking the exemption must be primarily engaged in the activity it is seeking to perform under the direction of a licensed mortgage broker.  The Division's published Opinion 97-061 further states that ""this exemption would be effective provided that the Licensee completes and files with the Division a Statement of Accountability agreeing to take responsibility for the exempt individual's activities and the individual seeking the exemption completes and files the required Exemption Affidavit.""  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2006 examination/inspection revealed that sixty-five independent contractors originated approximately 628 loans on behalf of Alpine Financial since 2004.  Alpine Financial did not file the required Exemption Affidavits and Statements of Accountability for the independent contractors referenced in Paragraph 28 until the Division's examiners alerted the Company to the issue during the 2006 examination/inspection.  Because Alpine Financial had failed to file the aforementioned required Exemption Affidavits and Statements of Accountability, the Division was unable to determine if Alpine Financial, had satisfied the qualifying standards for unlicensed individuals acting in the capacity of mortgage brokers associated with and under the direction of a licensed mortgage brokers set forth by the relevant opinions published by the Division prior to the completion of the loan origination activity referenced in paragraph 28. 	 E. Failure to Notify the Division of Significant Events  During the 2006 examination/inspection, Alpine Financial verbally notified the Division's examiners that a branch office located in Worcester had been closed prior to the 2006 examination/inspection.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.13(2) states: 	 Licensees shall provide thirty days prior written notice of any change or closing of a Massachusetts location to the Commissioner and shall contain such other information as the Commissioner may require.  As of the date of this Order and Notice, the Division has not received notification of the events referenced in Paragraph 31 of this Order and Notice. 	 F. Interest Rate Lock Commitments  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(3) states, in part: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker to issue a mortgage loan rate lock commitment on its own behalf or on behalf of a mortgage lender, or to imply to a consumer that it can lock a rate on behalf of the consumer. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit a mortgage broker from taking a rate lock commitment fee for transmittal to a mortgage lender prior to the issuance by the mortgage lender of a commitment or approval, provided that prior to the taking of a rate lock commitment fee:  ...................................................  (b) the rate lock commitment fee is made payable by the consumer to the mortgage lender which intends to make the loan. A mortgage broker may only take a rate lock commitment fee for transmittal to the mortgage lender which intends to make the loan. Nothing herein shall prohibit a mortgage broker from negotiating the terms or conditions of a mortgage loan, including the interest rate, on behalf of a consumer. A mortgage broker may also use such forms or other evidence as desired to allow a consumer to indicate a preference to enter into a mortgage rate lock commitment with a mortgage lender. However, any such forms or evidence must clearly and conspicuously contain the following statement: ""This is a request, not a commitment, to lock your interest rate with a mortgage lender"".  The 2006 examination/inspection revealed that Alpine Financial provided consumers with a ""Loan Pricing Agreement Defining Interest Rate and Terms,"" which includes language that implies that Alpine Financial can lock a mortgage rate on behalf of the consumer. Such languages includes, but is not limited to, ""If a Commitment Fee amount is provided in the space below, you are required to pay that fee upon the execution of this Agreement to bind ALPINE to the terms of this agreement."" See Exhibit 6, which is attached hereto and incorporated by reference, which presents the inferring language in its entirety.  The Agreement referenced in the preceding paragraph did not contain the required language, ""This is a request, not a commitment, to lock your interest rate with a mortgage lender."" 	 G. Engaging in Prohibited Advertising Practices  Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.04(2) states, in part: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to advertise without clearly and conspicuously disclosing its business name, the words ""broker"" or ""lender"", as applicable, and the license number.  Alpine Financial did not properly disclose the Company's license type and number in its consumer solicitations as required pursuant to 940 CMR 8.04(2). Alpine Financial also disclosed an incorrect license number on the Company's website.  Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.04(1) states: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to make any representation or statement of fact in an advertisement if the representation or statement is false or misleading or has the tendency or capacity to be misleading, or if the mortgage broker or lender does not have sufficient information upon which a reasonable belief in the truth of the representation or statement could be based.  Alpine Financial provided consumers with a solicitation that stated, ""You have been pre-approved for a loan"" and contained the Equal Housing Lender logo. Such representations in the solicitation have the tendency or capacity to mislead consumers as they present the appearance that the Company, a mortgage broker is approving or funding loans.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(4) states: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker to advertise any interest rate or loan term described in 209 CMR 32.24(3)(a) in any media without the following statement: ""We arrange but do not make loans"". No advertisement by a mortgage broker in any media shall contain language which indicates or suggests that the mortgage broker will fund or approve a mortgage loan or guarantee any rate.  Alpine Financial's website and consumer solicitation advertise interest rates and/or loan terms without including the statement, ""We arrange but do not make loans"" as required pursuant to 209 CMR 42.12A(4).  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.04(4)(d) states: 	 (4) It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to engage in bait advertising or to misrepresent (directly or by failure to adequately disclose) the terms, conditions or charges incident to the mortgage loan being advertised in any advertisement. Violation of 940 CMR 8.04(4) shall include, but not be limited to:  ...................................................  (d) the advertisement through terms such as ""bad credit no problem"" or words of similar import or that an applicant will have unqualified access to credit without clearly and conspicuously disclosing the material limitations on the availability of credit that may exist, such as:  requirements for the availability of credit (such as income);  that a higher rate or more points may be required for a consumer with bad credit; and  that restrictions as to the maximum principal amount of the loan offered may apply.  Alpine Financial's website contains the phrase ""Bankruptcy & Foreclosure OK!"" presenting the appearance that applicants will have unqualified access to credit and does not include the disclosure language required pursuant to 940 CMR 8.04(4)(d).  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 167, section 37 states, in part: 	 A person, domestic or foreign corporation, partnership, association, limited liability company or similar entity shall not make reference to an existing bank, federal bank, federal branch, foreign bank, out-of-state bank, out-of-state branch, out-of-state federal bank as defined in section 1 of this chapter, or federal credit union as defined in section 1 of chapter 171, or any subsidiary thereof, without the express written consent of the bank, federal bank, federal branch, foreign bank, out-of-state bank, out-of-state branch, out-of-state federal bank or federal credit union, or any subsidiary thereof, or make reference to a loan number, loan amount or other specific loan information on the outside of an envelope, visible through the envelope window, or on a postcard in connection with any written solicitation or an email for products or services to a specifically identified consumer.  Alpine Financial's consumer solicitation references ""Salem Five Cents Mtg"" without the written consent from Salem Five Cents Savings Bank, an existing state-chartered bank.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 32.24(2) states: 	 If an advertisement states a rate of finance charge, it shall state the rate as an ""annual percentage rate,"" using that term. If the annual percentage rate may be increased after consummation, the advertisement shall state that fact. The advertisement shall not state any other rate, except that a simple annual rate or periodic rate that is applied to an unpaid balance may be stated in conjunction with, but not more conspicuously than, the annual percentage rate.  Alpine Financial's website advertises ""rates as low as 1.25%"" but fails to state the ""annual percentage rate"" as required pursuant to 209 CMR 32.24(2). Additionally, Alpine Financial's consumer solicitation discloses a simple annual rate more conspicuously that the annual percentage rate.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 32.24(3)(b) states: 	 An advertisement stating any of the terms in 209 CMR 32.24(3)(a) [e.g. amount of any payment] shall state the following terms, as applicable:  1. The amount or percentage of the downpayment.  2. The terms of repayment.  3. The ""annual percentage rate"", using that term, and, if the rate may be increased after consummation, that fact.  Alpine Financial's website and consumer solicitation set forth payment amounts but fail to include the addition disclosures required pursuant to 209 CMR 32.24(3)(b).  The above-referenced consumer solicitation and web pages are attached hereto as Exhibits 7 and 8, respectively, and are incorporated by reference. 	 VIOLATIONS  NOW, THEREFORE, the Division hereby sets forth the following Charges against Alpine Financial:  The Division hereby re-alleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 51 of this Order and Notice as though fully set forth.  CHARGE ONE:  By falsifying applicants' income information on mortgage loan applications, Alpine Financial violated Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 93A, section 2(a).  CHARGE TWO:  By charging loan fees, points, or similar fees in a mortgage transaction involving residential property located in the Commonwealth, of four or less units and occupied in whole or in part by the mortgagor, in amounts exceeding those previously disclosed for such fees or points to the mortgagor in writing, Alpine Financial has violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 183, section 63.  CHARGE THREE : Alpine Financial has solicited or accepted residential mortgage loan applications for property located in Massachusetts from individuals engaging in the activity of a mortgage broker who were not employed by the Company and who otherwise failed to qualify for an exemption from licensure under the provisions of General Laws chapter 255E, section 2 as set forth by the Division by prior published opinions, including without limitation, Opinions 97-061, and 97-222.  CHARGE FOUR:  By compensating unlicensed business entities for loans originated through the Company, Alpine Financial has violated the Attorney General's Regulation 940 CMR 8.06(9).  CHARGE FIVE:  By closing a Massachusetts office location without first notifying the Commissioner, in writing, at least thirty days prior to the closing of the office locations, Alpine Financial has violated the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.13(2).  CHARGE SIX:  By providing the ""Loan Pricing Agreement Defining Interest Rate and Terms"" form which presents the inference that the Company can lock an interest rate on behalf of the consumer and by failing to include required disclosure language in the aforementioned Agreement, Alpine Financial has violated the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(3).  CHARGE SEVEN:  By failing to disclose and/or inaccurately disclosing the Company's license type and number on its consumer solicitations, mailings and the Company's website, Alpine Financial has violated the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.15.  CHARGE EIGHT:  By mailing consumer solicitations that contained false or misleading language or had the tendency to be false or misleading, Alpine Financial has violated the Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.04(1).

CHARGE FIFTEEN:  Had the foregoing existed at the time of Alpine Financial's original mortgage broker license application, such conditions would have warranted a denial by the Commissioner of the license application and are grounds for the revocation of Alpine Financial's mortgage broker license number(s) MB2386  et al ., as stated in Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6. 	 PRAYER FOR RELIEF  WHEREFORE, the Division, by and through the Commissioner  ,  prays for a final decision as follows: 	 For a final Agency decision awarding temporary and preliminary injunctive relief, and any other ancillary relief, as may be necessary to protect the public interest during the pendency of this matter.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE BROKER  LICENSING  Docket No. 2008-013  FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  HOMERUN MORTGAGE, LLC  Dedham, Massachusetts  Mortgage Broker License No(s): MB2640 and MB3016  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that HOMERUN MORTGAGE, LLC (""HomeRun Mortgage"" or the ""Company""), located at 260 Court Street, Dedham, Massachusetts, has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""Temporary Order"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  HomeRun Mortgage is, and at all relevant times has been, a Massachusetts limited liability company doing business in the Commonwealth. HomeRun Mortgage's main office is located at 260 Court Street, Dedham, Massachusetts.  HomeRun Mortgage is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage broker license, license number MB2640, to HomeRun Mortgage to engage in the business of a mortgage broker in Massachusetts on or about May 30, 2002. License number MB2640 authorized HomeRun Mortgage to conduct its mortgage broker business from the Company's main office located at 260 Court Street, Dedham, Massachusetts (the ""Dedham location"").  HomeRun Mortgage maintains an additional licensed office location at 1106 Main Street, Brockton, Massachusetts, from which the Company conducts its mortgage broker business. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner issued a mortgage broker license, license number MB3016, to HomeRun Mortgage for that location on or about February 28, 2003.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8 states, in part, that: 	 The commissioner shall inspect a licensee's relevant records and evidence of compliance with the provisions of this chapter or any rule or regulation issued hereunder and with any other law, rule or regulation applicable to the conduct of the business for which it is licensed under this chapter. For the purposes of such inspection, the commissioner or a representative of the commissioner shall have access to the offices and place of business, books, accounts, papers, records and files of all such licensees.  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 48.06(2) as made applicable to the Company by 209 CMR 42.09(1) states, in part, that: 	 Failure of a Licensee to keep its books and records in accordance with 209 CMR 48.00  et seq . may result in suspension or revocation of the license under the authority contained in the specific statute applicable to the Licensee.  On Monday, July 7, 2008, pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division commenced an examination/inspection of HomeRun Mortgage's books and records at the Dedham location for the purpose of assessing the Company's level of compliance with applicable Massachusetts statutes and the Division's regulations governing the conduct of those engaged in the business of a mortgage broker in the Commonwealth. 	 The Dedham location was locked upon arrival. The Division's examiners then telephoned Peggy Davis-Mullen, the manager and sole member of HomeRun Mortgage, who indicated that she was out of state and she agreed to meet with the Division's examiners at the Dedham location on Thursday, July 10, 2008.  On Thursday, July 10, 2008, the Division's examiners returned to the Dedham location to commence an on-site inspection and conduct a review of the Company's books, records, accounts, and files. In addition, the Division's examiners spoke with Ms. Davis-Mullen, and verbally requested that HomeRun Mortgage provide certain specific records, including, but not limited to: 	 HomeRun Mortgage's operating account information;  Payroll information;  A loan list for all brokering activity since the Division's last office inspection and access to all files;  Reconcilement(s) for all cash accounts, including the operating account of HomeRun Mortgage;  Reconcilement(s) for all customer escrow accounts; and  A copy of HomeRun Mortgage's examination/inspection response to the Report of Examination/Inspection on Consumer Compliance issued by the Division in 2006 along with supporting materials evidencing HomeRun Mortgage's completion of the corrective measures required by the findings of such Report.  In subsequent communications via telephone and in person with Ms. Davis-Mullen on Thursday, July 10, 2008, the Division's examiners emphasized that all information requested in Paragraph 8 of this Temporary Order was required as soon as possible.  During the conversations referenced in Paragraph 9, of this Temporary Order, the Division's examiners expressed concern with some of the information reviewed and provided by Ms. Davis-Mullen during the course of the day. As a result, the Division's examiners requested additional information relating to the operating accounts of HomeRun Mortgage and payments made to loan originators as well as other interested parties related to the mortgage broker business. Ms. Davis-Mullen indicated that she was unable to provide this information to the Division's examiners.  During the course of the examination/inspection, referenced in Paragraph 7 of this Temporary Order the examiners reviewed several loan files that contained mortgage loan documents that had been altered by whiting out information and cutting and pasting borrower information. These documents included purchase and sale agreements, settlement statements, loan applications, and credit reports. As a result, the Division's examiners immediately sealed and secured file cabinets and internal offices containing all remaining loan files on the premises for further review.  During a conversation with Ms. Davis-Mullen on Thursday, July 10, 2008, she stated that she would be unavailable on Friday, July 11, 2008 and the Division's examiner's indicated that they would return on Monday, July 14, 2008 at 9:00 a.m. to proceed with the examination/inspection. Ms Davis-Mullen confirmed that she would be present at the Dedham location to permit the Division's examiners access to the location.  On, Monday, July 14, 2008, the Division's examiners arrived at the Dedham location and were denied access to the files as the licensed location was locked and there was no indication that Ms. Davis-Mullen was available. The Division's examiners attempted to contact Ms. Davis-Mullen on her cellular phone several times between 9:00 a.m. and 10:30 a.m. however all but one call was unanswered. One telephone call was answered by an unknown individual, however upon receiving notice that the Division's examiners were at the licensed location, the unidentified individual terminated the phone call. The Division's examiners attempted to place calls to the Company's office phones but received busy signals on all lines. In response, the Division's examiners left at least three voicemail messages on both Ms. Davis-Mullen's cellular phone and another cellular number that was provided to the Division's examiners. As of the effective date of this Temporary Order, Ms. Davis-Mullen remains unresponsive to the Division's repeated attempts to contact her.  As of the effective date of this Temporary Order, the Division has not received any of the documents requested in Paragraph 8 of this Temporary Order and continues to be denied access to the licensed location in order to conclude its examination.  By a letter to the Division dated Friday, July 11, 2008 and faxed to the Division on that date, Ms. Davis-Mullen, notified the Division that the Company was withdrawing it's pending applications to renew the Company's mortgage broker licenses MB2640 and MB3016, effective immediately.  The facts and circumstances set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 14, which precipitated the issuance of this Temporary Order, preceded HomeRun Mortgage's attempt to withdraw its renewal application for its Massachusetts mortgage broker licenses as described above. 	 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 16, HomeRun Mortgage repeatedly failed to provide the Division's representatives with full access to HomeRun Mortgage's books, accounts, records and files to permit an inspection of such records, in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 16, HomeRun Mortgage has failed to demonstrate the character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.06(2).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 16, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 HomeRun Mortgage has engaged in, is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that it is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage broker including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. ; and  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an Order to cease and desist to HomeRun Mortgage.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 16, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of HomeRun Mortgage's original mortgage broker license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 16, present sufficient grounds for the revocation of HomeRun Mortgage's mortgage broker licenses pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.07(2)(b). 	 ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that HomeRun Mortgage and any and all officers, members, managers, employees, independent contractors, or agents operating on behalf of HomeRun Mortgage, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of; (a) a mortgage broker, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, and (b) a mortgage loan originator, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Temporary Order. Therefore, HomeRun Mortgage is ordered to immediately cease soliciting or accepting, either directly or indirectly, any residential mortgage loan applications from consumers for residential property located in Massachusetts.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that HomeRun Mortgage shall immediately place any fees previously collected from Massachusetts consumers relative to any pending mortgage loan applications in a separate escrow account maintained at a federally insured bank.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that HomeRun Mortgage shall immediately place with one or more qualified broker(s) or lender(s), as appropriate based on the status of the application and with no loss to applicants, all of its pending Massachusetts residential mortgage loan applications. HomeRun Mortgage shall obtain the prior approval of the Commissioner before placing such applications to the qualified broker(s) or lender(s).  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that HomeRun Mortgage shall submit to the Commissioner a detailed record, prepared as of the date of submission, of all of the Company's pending residential mortgage loan applications on property located in Massachusetts. The records to be produced shall be submitted to the Commissioner within five (5) days of the effective date of this Temporary Order and shall include all information on file, regarding the Company's open application list, including but not necessarily limited to, the following: 	 All information on file as of the date of submission regarding HomeRun Mortgage's open application list as a mortgage broker, including but not limited to, the following: The names of all individuals from whom HomeRun Mortgage has accepted an application for a residential mortgage loan; the applicants' addresses and telephone numbers; the amount of all prepaid loan fees submitted by the customer; the amount of each loan; application status (i.e. filed, submitted to lenders, cleared to close, etc.); scheduled closing dates; rate lock status; and a list identifying the applicable broker or lender with whom the applicants' application was placed. The latter list should include telephone numbers of contact persons familiar with the Company's submitted loans.  HomeRun Mortgage shall immediately secure all pending residential mortgage loan application files and, to the extent that any original documents must be forwarded to the relevant mortgage lender(s) and or mortgage broker(s) pursuant to Paragraph 24 of this Temporary Order, a copy of such document, correspondence, or paper relating to the mortgage loan shall be retained in HomeRun Mortgage's books and records and shall be available to the Commissioner, in their entirety, upon request.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that HomeRun Mortgage shall submit to the Commissioner a copy of each of the books, records, and files which were requested during the Division's examination/inspection on July 10, 2008, as set forth in Paragraph 8 of this Temporary Order, and which HomeRun Mortgage has failed to provide to the Division as of the issuance of this Temporary Order.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that HomeRun Mortgage shall immediately secure all records, files, and documents (""Records"") pertaining to the Company including those previously secured by the Division as referenced in Paragraph 11 of this Temporary Order. HomeRun Mortgage is prohibited from destroying, altering, and/or modifying any of the referenced Records. The Records shall be available to the Commissioner in their entirety upon request.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Temporary Order shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under General Laws chapter 30A.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such Temporary Order shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from HomeRun Mortgage within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this Temporary Order. If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this Temporary Order shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.

FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  Mortgage Specialists is, and at all relevant times, has been a foreign corporation conducting business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Mortgage Specialists' main office is located at 2 Main Street, Plaistow, New Hampshire.  Mortgage Specialists is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued mortgage broker license number MB0413 to Mortgage Specialists to engage in the business of a mortgage broker on or around February 13, 1992. License number MB0413 authorized Mortgage Specialists to conduct the mortgage broker business from an office located at 1 Mount Pleasant Drive, Peabody, Massachusetts. On or around May 25, 1999, the Commissioner issued mortgage broker license number MB1643 to Mortgage Specialists to conduct business from the Corporation's main office located at 2 Main Street, Plaistow, New Hampshire.  Mortgage Specialists maintains additional office locations from which the Corporation conducts its mortgage broker business. According to records maintained on file with the Division, Mortgage Specialists currently possesses six (6) additional mortgage broker licenses from the Commissioner for locations operated both in Massachusetts as well as outside the Commonwealth.  Mortgage brokers in Massachusetts are licensed and regulated under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, which is administered and enforced by the Commissioner. Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division is authorized to inspect the books, accounts, papers, records, and files of mortgage brokers transacting business in Massachusetts to determine compliance with the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E or any rule, or regulation issued thereunder, and with any law, rule, or regulation applicable to the conduct of the business of a mortgage broker.  On March 25, 2008, pursuant to the authority granted under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division commenced an examination/inspection of the books, accounts, papers, records, and files maintained by Mortgage Specialists (the ""2008 examination/inspection""). The 2008 examination/inspection was conducted on-site at the Corporation's main office in Plaistow, New Hampshire. The 2008 examination/inspection revealed findings that Mortgage Specialists engaged in acts and practices in violation of state laws and regulations as set forth herein. 	 A. Unfair and/or Deceptive Business Practices  Misleading Representations of a Prospective Borrower's Income  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) states:  	Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1) states, in part:  	It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to make any representation or statement of fact if the representation or statement is false or misleading or has the tendency or capacity to be misleading.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that Mortgage Specialists falsified asset and income information in three residential loan transactions, each involving stated-income loan products, originated on behalf of a single borrower over a period of less than twelve months as described below: 	 Loan #7359012929: A stated income loan application for a loan which closed on January 26, 2005, indicated that the borrower, a registered nurse employed by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, earned approximately $7,253 monthly or $87,036 annually.  Loan #20010353 & Loan #4635006706: Stated income loan applications for loans which closed on May 4, 2005 and September 19, 2005, respectively, indicate that the same borrower identified above in subparagraph 9(a) earned approximately $8,253 monthly or $99,036 annually.  Publicly available Commonwealth payroll records indicate that the borrower earned approximately $1,303 monthly or $17,699 annually in 2007.  In response to the Division's inquiry regarding the apparent discrepancy, an officer of Mortgage Specialists stated that an internal investigation by the Corporation revealed that the borrower's income was combined with her husband's income on the loan applications completed by Mortgage Specialists. However, the loan applications did not include her husband as a co-applicant.  Mortgage Specialists knew or should have known that the above referenced income and/or asset information would be relied upon in underwriting the mortgage loan by the mortgage lender or financial institution to which the mortgage loan applications were brokered by Mortgage Specialists. 	 Altering Mortgage Loan Related Documents in a Residential Loan Transaction  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(7), effective as of September, 8, 2006, states:  	It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker or mortgage lender to sign a consumer's name to a mortgage loan application or mortgage loan documents on behalf of a consumer.  On or around June 12, 2008, while the findings of the 2008 examination/inspection were being reviewed and finalized, the Division was notified by the New Hampshire Banking Department that, during a routine examination/inspection of Mortgage Specialists by the New Hampshire Banking Department, mortgage loan documents relating to Massachusetts residential loan transactions had been found in a shredding bin used by Mortgage Specialists. According to the New Hampshire examiners, the mortgage loan documents contained borrowers' signatures that appeared to have been altered.  On or around June 12, 2008, as a result of the events referenced in Paragraph 12 of this Temporary Order, the Division's examiners returned to Mortgage Specialists' main office located at 2 Main Street, Plaistow, New Hampshire to examine the mortgage loan documents discovered by the New Hampshire Banking Department and to review additional records and files found in the shredding bin (the ""June 2008 visitation"").  Records and files reviewed by the Division's examiners during the June 2008 visitation indicated that Mortgage Specialists altered loan-related documents by cutting and pasting applicants' signatures onto mortgage loan disclosures and loan-related documents. Specifically, the examiners discovered that in one loan file the borrowers' signatures on a Mortgage Broker Fee Agreement had been cut and subsequently affixed onto the signature line of an Appraisal Disclosure.  Records and files forwarded to the Division's examiners by the New Hampshire Banking Department on July 28, 2008 indicated that Mortgage Specialists altered loan-related documents by cutting applicants' signatures from an unknown form and thereafter pasting those signatures onto at least two copies of a ""Massachusetts Net Tangible Benefit Disclosure and Acknowledgement"" Form. (Loan No. 1500560233). 	 B. Refinancing in the Borrower's Interest  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 183, section 28C(a) states in part:  	A lender shall not knowingly make a home loan if the home loan pays off all or part of an existing home loan that was consummated within the prior 60 months or other debt of the borrower, unless the refinancing is in the borrower's interest. The ""borrower's interest"" shall be narrowly construed, and the burden is upon the lender to determine that the refinancing is in the borrower's interest.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 53.07(1)(b) states in part:  	A lender may request that a borrower acknowledge receipt of such a worksheet or other documentation; provided, however, a lender shall not shift the burden to the borrower to demonstrate that a home loan is in the borrowers' interest.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker, Mortgage Specialists provided consumers a ""Statement of Borrower's Benefits"" (""Statement""), a document that only mortgage lenders are authorized to provide to borrowers pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 183, section 28C(a).  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection also revealed that the language used in the Statement provided to the applicable consumers was not in compliance with 209 CMR 53.07(1)(b) inasmuch as it shifted the burden to the consumers to demonstrate that the loan was in the borrowers' interest and to their benefit. 	 C. Providing Mortgage Lender Disclosures to Consumers  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection indicate that Mortgage Specialists routinely provided several mortgage lender disclosures to consumers in excess of its authority as a mortgage broker in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  The mortgage lender disclosures include, but are not limited to, the Truth In Lending Disclosure, Equal Credit Opportunity Notices, and Notice to Applicant of Right to Receive Copy of Appraisal Report. 	 D. Failure to Properly Maintain Books and Records  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.09(1) states, in part, that:  	Each Licensee shall keep and use its books, records and accounts in a manner which will allow the Commissioner to determine whether the Licensee is complying with the provisions of M.G.L. c. 255E and applicable state and federal laws and regulations. Each Licensee shall comply with the provisions of 209 CMR 48.00...  	(b)The mortgage broker … shall retain for a minimum of three years after a mortgage loan is made the following: the original loan origination and compensation agreement as set out in 209 CMR 42.16; a copy of the settlement statement; an account of fees received in connection with the loan; correspondence; papers or records relating to the loan; and such other documents as the Commissioner may require.  Books and records forwarded to the Division's examiners on July 28, 2008 by the New Hampshire Banking Department indicated that Mortgage Specialists failed to properly retain sufficient documentation to enable the Commissioner to determine whether the Corporation was complying with certain laws and regulations governing mortgage brokers in Massachusetts. Specifically, the New Hampshire Banking Department retrieved at least two loan files containing original signatures which related to two separate Massachusetts loan transactions from a ""shredding bin"" retained by Mortgage Specialists.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 48.04 states, in part:  	Each Licensee shall keep and use its books, records, and accounts within the Commonwealth, except, however, that with the prior approval by the Commissioner of a written plan, a Licensee may keep such books, records, and accounts at a location, or locations, outside of the Commonwealth.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 48.06 states, in part, that:  	A Licensee may amend its written plan from time to time and such amendment shall not be effective until approved by the Commissioner.  According to Division records, Mortgage Specialists received approval from the Division to maintain its books and records at the Corporation's main office located at 2 Main Street, Plaistow, New Hampshire.  The 2008 examination/inspection revealed that Mortgage Specialists maintains its loan files at an off-site storage facility. Mortgage Specialists neither filed for nor received approval from the Division to maintain its records at that location. 	 E. Loan Origination and Compensation Agreement  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(5) states in part:  	It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker to fail to provide to the consumer at the time of application the loan origination and compensation agreement required under 209 CMR 42.16. The content of the agreement shall strictly conform to 209 CMR 42.16 and include signatures and dates by the consumer(s) and the mortgage broker.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that in all loan files reviewed, Mortgage Specialists issued Loan Origination and Compensation Agreements which did not strictly conform with 209 CMR 42.16. 	 F. Failure to Provide Notification of Regulatory Action  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.12(1)(c) states, in part:  	A Licensee shall notify the Commissioner immediately, and in writing within one business day, of the occurrence of any of the following significant developments: . . . (c) [R]eceiving notification of the institution of . . . cease and desist, suspension or revocation procedures, or other formal or informal regulatory action, in any state against the Licensee, and the reasons thereof.  On July 24, 2008, the State of New Hampshire Banking Department (""New Hampshire Department"") issued an Order to Show Cause and Cease and Desist Order, Case No. 08-223, against Mortgage Specialists (""New Hampshire Order""). The New Hampshire Order contains a Staff Petition in which the staff of the New Hampshire Department allege the following violations of New Hampshire law: incomplete records; failure to supervise; failure to facilitate exam; dishonest or unethical practices; fraud; destruction of records; violation of federal statutes and regulations; and failure to notify of balloon payments.  As of the effective date of this Temporary Order, the Division has not received notification from Mortgage Specialists of the occurrence of the events referenced above in Paragraph 31 of this Temporary Order. 	 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 32, Mortgage Specialists has failed to demonstrate and maintain the character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the mortgage broker business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 32, by falsifying borrowers' income information on Uniform Residential Loan Applications submitted in connection with residential mortgage transactions, Mortgage Specialists has violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) and the Office of the Attorney General's implementing regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 32, by engaging in the act or practice of altering documents relating to the mortgage loan process by affixing photocopied signatures to unsigned disclosure documents prior to submitting such documents to the mortgage lender, Mortgage Specialists has violated the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(7), Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) and the Office of the Attorney General's implementing regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 32, by providing disclosures to consumers that only lenders are authorized to provide Mortgage Specialists has exceeded its authority as a mortgage broker in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 32, by failing to keep and use its books and records in a manner which would allow the Commissioner to determine whether the Corporation was complying with applicable state and federal laws and regulations, Mortgage Specialists has violated the Division's regulations 209 CMR 42.09(1) and 209 CMR 48.03.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 32, by failing to file for approval amendments to the Corporation's out of state record-keeping plan, Mortgage Specialists has violated the Division's regulation 209 CMR 48.04.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 32, by modifying the language of the Loan Origination and Compensation Agreement provided to Massachusetts Consumers, Mortgage Specialists has violated the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(5).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 32, Mortgage Specialists failed to notify the Commissioner in writing, within one business day, that on July 24, 2008 the New Hampshire Banking Department issued an Order to Show Cause and Cease and Desist Order in violation of the Division's Regulation 209 CMR 42.12(1)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 32, the Commissioner has determined that:  	  	 Mortgage Specialists has engaged in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that the Corporation is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage broker including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00 et seq.  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to Mortgage Specialists.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 32, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of Mortgage Specialists original mortgage broker license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 32, present sufficient grounds for the revocation of Mortgage Specialists mortgage broker licenses pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.07(2)(b). ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST 	 After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that Mortgage Specialists and any and all officers, members, managers, employees, independent contractors, or agents operating on behalf of Mortgage Specialists, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of; (a) a mortgage broker, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, and (b) a mortgage loan originator, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Temporary Order.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE BROKER  LICENSING  Docket No. 2008-016  FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  POST ROAD FUNDING, INC D/B/A MILLENNIUM MORTGAGE  Springfield, Massachusetts  Mortgage Broker License No(s): MB2217 and MB4325  .  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that POST ROAD FUNDING, INC. D/B/A MILLENNIUM MORTGAGE (""Millennium Mortgage"" or the ""Corporation""), located at 1111 Main Street, Springfield, Massachusetts, has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""Temporary Order"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b).  FINDINGS OF FACT     1. The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  2. Millennium Mortgage is, and at all relevant times has been, a Massachusetts Corporation doing business in the Commonwealth. Millennium Mortgage's main office is located at 1111 Main Street, Springfield, Massachusetts.  3. According to the Division's records, Ward Weizel is the President and partial owner of Millennium Mortgage.  4. According to the Division's records, Paul Hatidani is an officer and majority owner of Millennium Mortgage.  5. Millennium Mortgage is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage broker license, license number MB2217, to Millennium Mortgage to engage in the business of a mortgage broker in Massachusetts on or about March 28, 2001. License number MB2217 authorized Millennium Mortgage to conduct its mortgage broker business from the Corporation's main office located at 1111 Main Street, Springfield, Massachusetts.  6. Millennium Mortgage maintains an additional licensed office location at 340 Main Street, Worcester, Massachusetts, from which the Corporation conducts its mortgage broker business. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner issued a mortgage broker license, license number MB4325, to Millennium Mortgage for that location on or about March 10, 2006.  7. Mortgage brokers in Massachusetts are licensed and regulated under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, which is administered and enforced by the Commissioner. Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division is authorized to inspect the books, accounts, papers, records, and files of mortgage brokers transacting business in Massachusetts to determine compliance with the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E or any rule, or regulation issued thereunder, and with any law, rule, or regulation applicable to the conduct of the business of a mortgage broker.  8. On Thursday, July 24, 2008, pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division commenced an examination/inspection of the books, accounts, papers, records, and files maintained by Millennium Mortgage to evaluate the Corporation's compliance with the laws, regulations, and regulatory bulletins applicable to the conduct of a mortgage broker business in Massachusetts (the 2008 examination/inspection). The 2008 examination/inspection was conducted at the Corporation's main office in Springfield, Massachusetts. The findings of the 2008 examination/inspection indicate that Millennium Mortgage engaged in acts and practices in violation of state laws and regulations as set forth herein and, in addition, sets forth other violations and areas of concern observed during the 2008 examination/inspection.     A. Unfair or Deceptive Acts and Practices     Alteration and/or Manipulation of Mortgage Loan Related Documents  9. The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(8), effective as of September, 8, 2006, states:  It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker of mortgage lender to falsify income or asset information on a mortgage loan application or mortgage loan documents.  10. Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) states:  Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.  11. The Attorney Generals regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1) states, in part:  It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to make any representation or statement of fact if the representation or statement is false or misleading or has the tendency or capacity to be misleading.  12. The 2008 examination/inspection revealed that Millennium Mortgage manipulated various mortgage loan related documents by using ""white out"" to obscure information related to the loan underwriting and approval process as set forth below. Millennium Mortgage also manipulated other mortgage loan related documents by cutting income, asset, and employment information from sources and individuals unrelated to the prospective borrowers and pasting/taping such information to documents including but not limited to pay stubs and W2 statements which were generated for the prospective borrowers. Examples include, but are not limited to the following:  (a) Loan #11694684:  i. A full documentation loan application prepared by Millennium Mortgage and signed on September 13, 2006, for a loan which ultimately closed on October 6, 2006, indicated that the borrower, a health care provider at a nursing services agency, earned approximately $2,700 monthly or $32,400 annually.  ii. At least three copies of a pay stub located in the loan file maintained by Millennium Mortgage indicated that the year to date gross income for the borrower as of September 15, 2006 was $22,991.66. Each of the copies of the pay stub had been manipulated to establish representations about the prospective borrower:  a. One copy of the pay stub was manipulated by using ""white out"" to obscure the employer and employee information which, upon closer inspection, was determined to be a pay stub previously issued to a loan originator employed by Millennium Mortgage.  b. A second copy of the pay stub contained employment information that corresponded to the employment information reported on the full documentation loan application signed on September 13, 2006, however, the employment information, including the borrowers name and employer name, was pasted onto the pay stub with ""clear tape"".  c. A third copy of the pay stub located in the file, contained information relating to the social security number, marital status, and taxable allowances which had been pasted onto the pay stub with ""clear tape"".  iii. A ""10-03 Quick Form"", so-called, which was routinely used by Millennium Mortgage to gather preliminary information from the prospective borrower for a loan application, indicates that the monthly income of the borrower was approximately $1,400 or $16,800 annually.  iv. The discrepancy between the information reflected on the loan application dated September 13, 2006, the altered pay stubs, and the information on the ""10-03 Quick Form"" reveals that Millennium Mortgage overstated the borrowers annual income by approximately $15,600.  v. A review of an employment verification letter located in the loan file revealed that it had been prepared on behalf of another applicant and thereafter altered by superimposing employment information including the gross salary of the borrower using ""clear tape"".  (b) Loan ""A""  1 :  i. Correspondence from the Social Security Administration indicated that a letter addressed to an individual on behalf of the borrower had been altered by removing the reference to the individual and altering the document so as to appear as though the borrower was the only recipient of the correspondence.  ii. A review of a copy of an employer letter maintained in the loan file indicated that the following statement had been added to the letter in reference to the borrower's income ""...YTD is $5,853.60."" The information was added by pasting/taping the statement onto the document which contained additional employee information.  (c) Loan #000553731-1:  i. A copy of an insurance binder located in the loan file reviewed by the Division's examiners revealed that the ""special conditions/other coverages"" section of the insurance binder contained the following phrase: ""policy period from 6/12/08 to 6/12/09 policy premium $392.00."" The phrase ""paid in full"" was thereafter taped directly below the preceding phrase so as to appear as though the annual insurance premium had been paid in full.  (d) Loan ""B.""  i. A Verification of Employment Form (""VOE"") located in the loan file and reviewed by the Division's examiners indicated that the borrower, a certified nurse's aid (""CNA"") earned approximately $11.46 hourly and $8,558.51 as of August 21, 2007. Four pay stubs reviewed by the Division's examiners corroborated the information reflected on the VOE.  ii. Two loan applications reviewed by the Division's examiners indicated that the same borrower was employed by a realty company as a manager and earned $3,000 monthly or $36,000 annually. However, a review of the loan file found no corroborating evidence of such employment.  iii. Two additional loan applications reviewed by the Division's examiners indicated that the same borrower was employed as a CNA at a different nursing home than that referenced above in subparagraph (d)(i) and earned $3,000 monthly or $36,000 annually.  iv. Original copies of W-2 statements for 2005 and 2006 revealed that the same borrower's annual income was $4,215.31 and $14,933.67 respectively.  v. Altered copies of W-2 statements for 2006 which were discovered in the loan file maintained by Millennium Mortgage revealed that the applicant's income had been increased from $14,933.67 to $36,949.12. The income information had been altered by pasting/taping the altered information over the actual income.  vi. Two automated underwriter submissions (""submissions"") prepared and submitted by Millennium Mortgage and dated June 12, 2007 and November 5, 2007 reflected an increase in the borrower's monthly income. The June 12, 2007 submission reflected a monthly income of $1,986.25 and the November 5, 2007 submission reflected a monthly income of $2,986.25.  vii. Several copies of pay stubs located in the loan filed reviewed by the Division's examiners revealed that pay stubs originally issued by the Town of Amesbury, Massachusetts to an unrelated individual were manipulated, by pasting the borrower's information on the employee section of the pay stub so as to appear as though the pay stub was issued to the borrower. This altered pay stub reported the borrower's year to date income as $27,906.63 as of September 28, 2007. The borrower's income was misrepresented by approximately $20,000.  (e) Loan ""C.""  i. A ""10-03 Quick Form"" located in the loan file indicates that the borrower earned $2,658.40 monthly as a technician and the co-borrower earned $2,217.64 monthly as a CNA.  ii. Pay stubs and W-2 statements located in the loan file corroborate the information reflected on the ""10-03 Quick Form.""  iii. Additional copies of W-2 statements located in the loan file revealed that the W-2 statement(s) were altered by superimposing the co-borrower's name and employment information onto the borrower's W-2 statement.  iv. A letter from the co-borrower's employer indicating a change in name of the company had been altered to add a title to the signatory's name.  (f) Loan ""D.""  i. A pay stub located in the file appears to have been generated by using the pay stub of an unrelated individual and inserting the prospective borrower's information, including employer, payment dates, and address by superimposing such information onto the pay stub so as to appear as though the borrower earned the salary reported for the unrelated individua  (g) Loan #0000201049:  i. A stated income loan application for a loan that ultimately closed on July 21, 2005 indicated that the borrower, a truck driver for a beverage distributor earned $6,500 monthly or $78,000 annually.  ii. An employer letter from a human resources representative, located in the loan file, revealed that the borrower earned $11.00 per hour as a fork truck driver. This indicates that applicant would have had to work approximately 19 hours per day in order to earn the income stated on the loan application.  (h) Loan # 0509205754:  i. A stated income loan application prepared by Millennium Mortgage for a loan which closed on October 5, 2005 indicated that the applicant maintained a bank account at a depository institution with a balance of $5,000.  ii. A Verification of Deposit form (""VOD"") located in the loan file maintained by Millennium Mortgage illustrated that the applicant maintained two accounts with the depository institution with balances of $5.40, and $6.97, and average balances of $328.83 and $266.74 respectively since the account had been opened on January 13, 2005.  13. Millennium Mortgage knew or should have known that the above referenced income and/or asset information may have been relied upon in underwriting the mortgage loan by the mortgage lender or financial institution to which the mortgage loan applications were brokered by Millennium Mortgage.  Misrepresentation of the Applicant's Residency Status  14. The 2008 examination/inspection revealed that in several instances Millennium Mortgage concealed and/or misrepresented information relating to the occupancy of the premises in violation of 940 CMR 8.06(1). Millennium Mortgage had submitted to lenders mortgage loan applications for two or more properties on behalf of a single borrower concurrently, with each application indicating that the subject property was to be used as the borrower's primary residence.  15. Without limitation, the above practices were observed in the following six loan transactions:  (a) Loan No(s).: 2112108765; 0848206270; 0000486260; 06-227372; 0658840; and 0605195918.  16. The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(7), effective as of September 8, 2006, states:  It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker or mortgage lender to sign a consumer's name to a mortgage loan application or mortgage loan documents on behalf of a consumer.  17. Books and records reviewed during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that Millennium Mortgage engaged in a pattern and/or practice of signing consumer's signatures on various mortgage broker disclosures including but not limited to Good Faith Estimates, Privacy Disclosures, and Certification and Authorization Agreements.  18. Several loan files reviewed by the Division's examiners indicated that the borrowers signatures varied significantly from signatures provided on loan documents signed at settlement. In addition, in at least one reviewed loan file an applicant's signature had been obscured with ""white out"" as the borrower's name had been misspelled during an apparent attempt by Millennium Mortgage to sign the document on the borrower's behalf.  19. The above practices were observed in, but not limited to, the following loan transactions: Loan No(s).: 11694684; 000553731-1; and 11423922.  B.   Engaging Unauthorized Individuals to Originate Mortgage Loans in Massachusetts  20. Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection indicate that Millennium Mortgage, at all relevant times, retained individuals in an independent contractor's capacity, who were engaging in the mortgage broker business and who were associated with and under the direction of Millennium Mortgage.  21. By prior published opinions, the Division set forth the standards which an individual operating in an independent contractor capacity would have to satisfy, in advance, when seeking to engage in the mortgage broker business that would be associated with and under the direction of a licensed mortgage broker under General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  22. Pursuant to the Division's published Opinion 97-222, the position of the Division of Banks is that exemption from licensure is available only to individuals and not to a corporate entity. The relationship between the licensee and the individual must be exclusive and the individual must execute an Exemption Affidavit to that effect. The licensee must execute a Statement of Accountability for all activities of the individual associated with it. The individual seeking the exemption must be primarily engaged in the activity it is seeking to perform under the direction of a licensed mortgage broker.  23. The Division's published Opinion 97-061 further states that ""this exemption would be effective provided that the licensee completes and files with the Division, in advance, a Statement of Accountability agreeing to take responsibility for the exempt individual's activities and the individual seeking the exemption completes and files the required Exemption Affidavit.""  24. Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that Millennium Mortgage did not file the required Exemption Affidavits and Statements of Accountability for any of the independent contractors who were operating on behalf of the Corporation.  25. Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that three individuals originated loans in Massachusetts on behalf of Millennium Mortgage in their capacity as independent contractors, but were not engaged in the activity of a mortgage broker as their primary occupation.  26. Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed, in addition, that two individuals engaged in originating loans in Massachusetts on behalf of Millennium Mortgage were not working in the mortgage broker industry exclusively on behalf of Millennium Mortgage.  C.   Undisclosed   Fees  27. Massachusetts General Laws chapter 183, section 63 states, in part:  A mortgagee, or a mortgage lender or mortgage broker as defined in section one of chapter two hundred and fifty-five E, shall not charge a loan fee, finder's fee, points, so-called, or similar fees in a mortgage transaction involving residential property located in the commonwealth of four or less units and occupied in whole or in part by the mortgagor, except to the extent that such fees or points have been previously disclosed to the mortgagor in writing, which disclosure may be in the form required by section seventeen D of chapter one hundred and eighty-four, or such other form which discloses said fees or points. A mortgagor shall not be obligated to pay fees or points which have not been previously disclosed as required herein.  28. Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection indicate that the Millennium Mortgage collected broker fees at the loan closing in amounts which the Corporation's books and records failed to illustrate had been fully and accurately disclosed to consumers, in writing, in the amounts charged at closing, if at all. Without limitation, these practices were observed in the following loan transactions: Loan No(s). 7883336-00 and 1890561308.  D.   Payment of Referral Fees  29. The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act's, (""RESPA"") implementing regulation, 24 CFR 3500.14(b) states in part:  No person shall give . . . any fee, kickback or other thing of value pursuant to any agreement or understanding, oral or otherwise, that business incident to or part of a settlement service involving a federally related mortgage loan shall be referred to any person. Any referral of a settlement service is not a compensable service, except as set forth in '3500.14(g) (1). A company may not pay any other company or the employees of any other company for the referral of settlement service business.  30. The RESPA implementing regulation, 24 CFR 3500.14(c) states, in part:  No person shall give . . . any portion, split, or percentage of any charge made or received for the rendering of a settlement service in connection with a transaction involving a federally related mortgage loan other than for services actually performed. A charge by a person for which no or nominal services are performed or for which duplicative fees are charged is an unearned fee and violates this section.  31. During the 2008 examination/inspection, a review of an income statement prepared and provided by Millennium Mortgage to the Division's examiners for review identified ""referral fee payments"" of $1,000 and $2,330 to at least two individuals.  32. Upon inquiry, Mr. Hatidani, General Manager of Millennium Mortgage stated that approximately 7 to 10 previous customers had been compensated for referring new customers whose loan applications resulted in a closed loan. Documents later provided by Mr. Hatidani to the Division's examiners indicated that at least six individuals had been paid a referral fee. It was determined that the six individuals compensated did not perform minimum services required to justify payment of a fee as set forth by applicable interpretive guidance by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the government agency responsible for interpreting RESPA.  E.   Failure   to Disclose License Revocation in a License Renewal Application  33. On April 17, 2007, the Division received Millennium Mortgage's 2007 Mortgage Broker License Renewal Application (""2007 License Renewal Application""), as required pursuant to the Division's licensing requirements.  34. Question 4(C) of the 2007 License Renewal Application, signed under the pains and penalties of perjury by Mr. Hatidani, asked the following question: ""In the past twelve months, has any State or federal regulatory agency or foreign financial regulatory authority: (5) denied, suspended, or revoked the  licensee's  or any control affiliate's or control person's registration or license or otherwise, by order, prevented it from associated with a  financial services-related  business or restricted its activities?"" The answer to the question provided by Mr. Hatidani was ""No.""  35. On February 4, 2008, Millennium Mortgage's 2008 License Renewal application (""2008 License Renewal Application"") was processed through the National Mortgage Licensing System (""NMLS""), as required pursuant to the Division's licensing requirements.  36. Question I of the 2008 License Renewal Application, submitted through NMLS by Mr. Hatidani asked the following question: ""Within the past 10 years... Has any State or federal agency...ever: (5) denied, suspended, or revoked your registration of license, disciplined you or otherwise by order, prevented you from associating with a financial services-related business or restricted your activities?"" The answer to the question provided by Mr. Hatidani was ""No.""  37. The Division's examiners determined that the questions referenced in Paragraphs 34 and 36 of this Temporary Order were not answered truthfully, as the Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation had issued a Notice of License Revocation to Millennium Mortgage that became effective on June 23, 2006.  F.   Failure to Provide Required Notice of Significant Events  Failure to Provide   Notification of the Closing of a Licensed Office Location  38. The Division's Regulation 209 CMR 42.13(2) states:  Licensees shall provide thirty days prior written notice of any change or closing of a Massachusetts location to the Commissioner and shall contain such other information as the Commissioner may require.  39. During the 2008 examination/inspection, representatives of Millennium Mortgage and the building's management company, notified the Division's examiners that the Worcester, Massachusetts licensed location had been closed for several weeks. As of the date of this Temporary Order, the Division has not received written notice of the closure of the Worcester location.  Failure to Provide Notification of Regulatory Action  40. The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.12(1)(c) states, in part:  (1) A Licensee shall notify the Commissioner immediately, and in writing within one business day, of the occurrence of any of the following significant developments: . . . (c) Receiving notification of the institution of license denial, cease and desist, suspension or revocation procedures, or other formal or informal regulatory action, in any state against the Licensee, and the reasons thereof.  41. On March 17, 2008, the Connecticut Department of Banking (""Connecticut Banking Department"") issued a Notice of Automatic Suspension, Notice of Intent to Revoke the Corporation's First Mortgage Broker License, and Notice of Right to Hearing against Millennium Mortgage (""Notice of Automatic Suspension"").  42. The Notice of Automatic Suspension alleged that on January 22, 2008, the Connecticut Banking Department received notification from Millennium Mortgage's insurance company indicating that the Corporation's mortgage broker bond would be cancelled as of February 27, 2008. As a result, on January 24, 2008, the Connecticut Banking Department forwarded a notification of the cancellation to Millennium Mortgage in order to give the Corporation the opportunity to show compliance with the requirements of the retention of Millennium Mortgage's mortgage broker license. As of the date of the issuance of the Notice of Suspension, the Connecticut Banking Department alleged that Millennium Mortgage had failed to replace the bond.  43. On April 18, 2008, the Notice of Automatic Suspension became permanent, as a result of Millennium Mortgage's failure to request a hearing or to replace the mortgage broker bond as required pursuant to the Connecticut Banking Department's licensing requirements.  44. As of the effective date of this Temporary Order, the Division has not received notification from Millennium Mortgage of the occurrence of any of the events referenced above in Paragraphs 41 through 43 of this Temporary Order.  G.   Failure to Properly Maintain Books and Records  45. The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.09(1) states:  Each Licensee shall keep and use its books, records and accounts in a manner which will allow the Commissioner to determine whether the Licensee is complying with the provisions of M.G.L. c. 255E and applicable state and federal laws and regulations. Each Licensee shall comply with the provisions of 209 CMR 48.00...  (b)The mortgage broker ... shall retain for a minimum of three years after a mortgage loan is made the following: the original loan origination and compensation agreement as set out in 209 CMR 42.16; a copy of the settlement statement; an account of fees received in connection with the loan; correspondence; papers or records relating to the loan; and such other documents as the Commissioner may require.  46. Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection indicated that Millennium Mortgage failed to retain sufficient documentation to enable the Division's examiners to determine whether the Corporation was complying with certain laws and regulations governing mortgage brokers in Massachusetts, including but not limited to, compliance with mandated timing requirements.  H.   Providing Mortgage Lender Disclosures to Consumers  47. Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection indicate that Millennium Mortgage, a mortgage broker, routinely provided several mortgage lender disclosures to consumers in violation of and exceeding its authority under G. L. c. 255E.  48. The mortgage lender disclosures include, but are not limited to, Equal Credit Opportunity Notices, Servicing Disclosure Statements, and Notice to Applicant of Right to Receive Copy of Appraisal Report.  I.   Failure to Properly Complete Good Faith Estimates  49. The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (""RESPA"") regulation 24 CMR 3500.7, Appendix B section 13 states, in part:  Any . . .fee or payment received by the mortgage broker from either the lender or the borrower arising from the initial funding transaction, including a servicing release premium or yield spread premium, is to be noted on the Good Faith Estimate and listed in the 800 series of the HUD-1 Settlement Statement.  50. Books and records reviewed during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that, in one of the loan files reviewed, Millennium Mortgage failed to disclose the yield spread premium paid at closing on the good faith estimate provided to the borrower(s), as specifically identified in the Report.  J.   Engaging in Prohibited Advertising Practices  51. Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.04(1) states:  It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to make any representation or statement of fact in an advertisement if the representation or statement is false or misleading or has the tendency or capacity to be misleading, or if the mortgage broker or lender does not have sufficient information upon which a reasonable belief in the truth of the representation or statement could be based.  52. Millennium Mortgage's website contains the following statements:  ""We offer you the competitive rates...Apply online today for a no-cost, no-obligation pre-approval!""  We lend in the following states: All States  In addition to our standard loan programs, you may benefit by obtaining one of our many special programs...

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE LENDER  LICENSING  Docket No. 2008-021  FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  SUN WEST MORTGAGE COMPANY, INC.  Cerritos, California  Mortgage Lender License No. ML3212  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that SUN WEST MORTGAGE COMPANY, INC., (""Sun West Mortgage"" or the ""Corporation""), located at 18303 Gridley Road, Cerritos, California, has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""Temporary Order"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage lender in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  Sun West Mortgage is, and at all relevant times has been, a foreign corporation doing business in the Commonwealth. Sun West Mortgage's main office of record is located at 18303 Gridley Road, Cerritos, California.  Sun West Mortgage is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage lender under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage lender license, license number ML3212 to Sun West Mortgage to engage in the business of a mortgage lender on or about August 23, 2007.  Mortgage lenders in Massachusetts are licensed and regulated under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, which is administered and enforced by the Commissioner. Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division is authorized to inspect the books, accounts, papers, records, and files of mortgage lenders transacting business in Massachusetts to determine compliance with the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E or any rule, or regulation issued thereunder, and with any law, rule, or regulation applicable to the conduct of the business of a mortgage lender.  On June 11, 2008, pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division commenced an examination of Sun West Mortgage's books and records, initially focusing on four Massachusetts reverse mortgage loan transactions completed by the Corporation, to evaluate the Corporation's compliance with the laws, regulations, and regulatory bulletins applicable to the conduct of a mortgage lender business in Massachusetts (the ""examination"").  The Division presented the findings of the examination in a letter (the ""Division's letter""), which was issued to Sun West Mortgage on the effective date of this Temporary Order. The Division's Letter identified significant failures to comply with applicable state laws, and regulations, governing the conduct of those engaged in the business of a mortgage lender in Massachusetts. 	 Making Reverse Mortgage Loans without Approval  Books and records reviewed during the examination revealed that Sun West Mortgage acted as a lender in all four of the reverse mortgage loan files reviewed. In addition, a loan list provided to the Division's examiners by the Corporation indicated that Sun West Mortgage had also acted as a lender in three additional Massachusetts reverse mortgage transactions since obtaining its mortgage company license on August 23, 2007.  Six of the reverse mortgage loans referenced above were HUD HECM (Home Equity Conversion Mortgage) reverse mortgage loans, insured by the Federal Housing Administration. One of the reverse mortgage loans referenced above was an uninsured proprietary reverse mortgage loan.  On or about December 10, 2007, Sun West Mortgage submitted to the Division an application for approval (""Application"") to offer the HUD HECM reverse mortgage loan program to Massachusetts consumers. At all relevant times, the Division was in communication with a representative of Sun West Mortgage via several e-mails and teleconferences each of which requested additional information in order to complete the review of the Application. As of the date of this Temporary Order, the Division has not approved the Corporation to offer the HUD HECM reverse mortgage loan program.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners revealed that Sun West Mortgage made at least six HUD HECM reverse mortgage loans to Massachusetts consumers between January 29, 2008 and April 18, 2008, while the Corporation's application for approval was pending.  The Division's records indicate that Sun West Mortgage also submitted an application for approval of the Corporation's private jumbo reverse mortgage (""Cashkeeper"") program on or around December 10, 2007. On March 24, 2008, Sun West Mortgage notified the Division of the discontinuance of the program and stated it was not offering the product.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners revealed that Sun West Mortgage made at least one proprietary Cashkeeper reverse mortgage loan on property located in Massachusetts on October 16, 2007.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 9 through 12 of this Temporary Order, Sun West Mortgage was fully aware that Massachusetts law requires mortgagees intending to make reverse mortgage loans to submit for the Division's approval, a program which meets specific criteria set forth in Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 167E, section 7, and made applicable to mortgagees through Massachusetts General Laws chapter 183, section 67, prior to making reverse mortgage loans in Massachusetts.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners revealed that Sun West Mortgage has made at least seven reverse mortgage loans on residential property located in the Commonwealth without receiving approval to do so. 	 Failure to Demonstrate Compliance with Massachusetts Borrower Protections in Reverse Mortgage Transactions  General Laws, chapter 167E, section 7(d)(2), made applicable to all mortgagees by General Laws, chapter 183, section 67 states: 	 The commissioner shall not approve a program for reverse mortgage loans which does not include the following:-  (2) an applicant for the loan shall not be bound for 7 days after his acceptance, in writing, of the lender's written commitment to make the loan.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners indicated that Sun West Mortgage failed to retain sufficient evidence in at least three loan files to demonstrate that the borrower's were afforded the seven day cooling off period subsequent to the acceptance of the Corporation's commitment to make the loan. 	 Failure to Document Prospective Borrowers' Completion of Mandatory Counseling with an Approved Agency  General Laws, chapter 167E, section 7(e), made applicable to all mortgagees by General Laws, chapter 183, section 67 states: 	 A bank shall not make a reverse mortgage loan as provided in this section until it has received a notice, in writing, that the prospective borrower has completed a reverse mortgage counseling program which has been approved by the executive office of elder affairs and which shall include instruction on reverse mortgage loans. The counseling program shall include, but is not limited to...  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners indicated that Sun West Mortgage failed to retain evidence in the loan files maintained by the Corporation, documenting that a reverse mortgage borrower had completed the mandatory counseling program and that the program had been approved by the Executive Office of Elder Affairs.  Books and records reviewed by the Divisions examiners indicated that at least one prospective borrower had completed a reverse mortgage counseling program with an agency that was not approved by the Executive Office of Elder Affairs. 	 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 19, Sun West Mortgage has failed to demonstrate and maintain the character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the mortgage lender business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.03(2)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 19, by making reverse mortgage loans prior to obtaining approval from the Division, Sun West Mortgage violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 167E, section 7, applicable to all mortgagees by Massachusetts General Laws chapter 183, section 67.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 19, by failing to provide documentation indicating that reverse mortgage borrowers were afforded a seven day cooling off period prior to settlement, Sun West Mortgage violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 167E, section 7(d)(2), applicable to all mortgagees by Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 183, section 67.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 19, by failing to ensure that consumers who obtained reverse mortgage loans were counseled through an agency approved by the Executive Office of Elder Affairs, when acting in the capacity of a mortgage lender, Sun West Mortgage violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 167E, section 7(e), applicable to all mortgagees by Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 183, section 67.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 19, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 Sun West Mortgage has engaged in, is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that it is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage lender including, but not limited to, Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00 et seq.; and  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to Sun West Mortgage.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 19, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of Sun West Mortgage's original mortgage lender license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 19 present sufficient grounds for the revocation of Sun West Mortgage's mortgage lender license pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.04(2)(b). 	 ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that Sun West Mortgage and any and all officers, members, managers, employees, independent contractors, or agents, operating on behalf of Sun West Mortgage, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of: (a) a mortgage lender, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, and (b) a mortgage loan originator, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Temporary Order. Therefore, Sun West Mortgage is ordered to immediately cease soliciting or accepting, either directly or indirectly, any residential mortgage loan applications from consumers for residential property located in Massachusetts.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Sun West Mortgage, shall immediately place any fees previously collected from Massachusetts consumers relative to any pending mortgage loan applications in a separate escrow account maintained at a federally insured bank.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Sun West Mortgage shall immediately place with one or more qualified lender(s), as appropriate based on the status of the application and with no loss to applicants, all of its pending Massachusetts residential mortgage loan applications.

In the event that no such placement can be made, Sun West Mortgage shall either independently fund the mortgage loan under such terms and conditions or buy down the mortgage loan offered by the lender so that the applicant does not incur a loss as a result of such placement.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE LENDER AND  MORTGAGE BROKER  LICENSING  Docket No. 2008-023  FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  GOLD REVERSE, INC.  f/k/a PACIFIC COMMUNITY MORTGAGE, INC.  Anaheim, California  Mortgage Company License No. MC4718  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that GOLD REVERSE, INC. f/k/a PACIFIC COMMUNITY MORTGAGE, INC. (""Gold Reverse"" or the ""Corporation""), located at 2099 S. State College Boulevard, Anaheim, California, has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""Temporary Order"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  Gold Reverse is, and at all relevant times has been, a foreign Corporation doing business in the Commonwealth. Gold Reverse's main office of record is located at 2099 S. State College Boulevard, Anaheim, California.  Gold Reverse is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage lender and mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage company license, license number MC4718 to Gold Reverse, under its former name of Pacific Community Mortgage, Inc., to engage in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker on or about March 29, 2007. On or about August 8, 2008, the Corporation notified the Division of its new name, Gold Reverse, Inc., which is the name under which the Corporation is currently licensed in the Commonwealth.  Mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers in Massachusetts are licensed and regulated under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, which is administered and enforced by the Commissioner. Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division is authorized to inspect the books, accounts, papers, records, and files of mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers transacting business in Massachusetts to determine compliance with the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E or any rule, or regulation issued thereunder, and with any law, rule, or regulation applicable to the conduct of the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker.  On September 4, 2008, pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division commenced an examination of Gold Reverse's books and records to evaluate the Corporation's compliance with the laws, regulations, and regulatory bulletins applicable to the conduct of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker business in Massachusetts (the ""examination"").  The Division presented the findings of the examination in a letter (the ""Division's letter""), which was issued to Gold Reverse on the effective date of this Temporary Order The Division's letter identified significant failures to comply with applicable state and federal laws, rules, regulations, and regulatory bulletins governing the conduct of those engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts. 	 Making Reverse Mortgage Loans without Approval  Books and records reviewed during the examination revealed that Gold Reverse acted as a lender in all three of the reverse mortgage loan files reviewed. In addition, all three reverse mortgage loans were made by the Corporation between May 2007 and July 2007. Gold Reverse had identified the three reverse mortgage loans as representing the total of all Massachusetts mortgage loans completed under its Massachusetts license since the date of initial licensure, March 29, 2007.  On or about August 7, 2008, Gold Reverse submitted to the Division an application for approval to offer reverse mortgage loans to Massachusetts consumers. As of the date of this Temporary Order, the Division has not approved the Corporation to offer any reverse mortgage loan programs.  Gold Reverse knew or should have known that Massachusetts law requires mortgagees intending to make reverse mortgage loans to submit for the Division's approval a program which meets specific criteria set forth in Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 167E, section 7, and made applicable to mortgagees through Massachusetts General Laws chapter 183, section 67.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners revealed that Gold Reverse has made at least three reverse mortgage loans on residential property located in the Commonwealth without receiving approval to do so. 	 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 10, Gold Reverse has failed to demonstrate and maintain the character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the mortgage lender and mortgage broker business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulations 209 CMR 42.03(2)(c) and 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 10, by making reverse mortgage loans prior to obtaining approval from the Division, Gold Reverse violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 167E, section 7, applicable to all mortgagees by Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 183, section 67.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 10, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 Gold Reverse has engaged in, is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that it is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker including, but not limited to, Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00 et seq.; and  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to Gold Reverse.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 10, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of Gold Reverse's original mortgage lender and mortgage broker license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 10 present sufficient grounds for the revocation of Gold Reverse's mortgage lender and mortgage broker licenses pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 and the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.04(2)(b) and 42.07(2)(b). 	 ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that Gold Reverse and any and all officers, members, managers, employees, independent contractors, or agents, operating on behalf of Gold Reverse, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of: (a) a mortgage lender and mortgage broker, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, and (b) a mortgage loan originator, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Temporary Order. Therefore, Gold Reverse is ordered to immediately cease soliciting or accepting, either directly or indirectly, any residential mortgage loan applications from consumers for residential property located in Massachusetts.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Gold Reverse, shall immediately place any fees previously collected from Massachusetts consumers relative to any pending mortgage loan applications in a separate escrow account maintained at a federally insured bank.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Gold Reverse shall immediately place with one or more qualified broker(s) or lender(s), as appropriate based on the status of the application and with no loss to applicants, all of its pending Massachusetts residential mortgage loan applications. It being understood that ""no loss to the applicant"" shall mean that any loan which may have been closed by Gold Reverse and remains unfunded, as well as any pending application which has been approved by the Corporation but has not yet closed, shall be placed to a lender willing to fund, or close, the mortgage loan under the same terms and conditions extended by Gold Reverse. In the event that no such placement can be made, Gold Reverse shall either independently fund the mortgage loan under such terms and conditions or buy down the mortgage loan offered by the lender so that the applicant does not incur a loss as a result of such placement. Gold Reverse shall obtain the prior approval of the Commissioner before placing such applications to the qualified lender(s) or broker(s) as appropriate.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that as soon as possible, but in no event later than two days after the effective date of this Temporary Order, Gold Reverse shall submit the following information in writing to the Commissioner: 	 A detailed record of all pending residential mortgage loan applications, from both the Corporation's lending and its brokering operations, which shall include, but is not limited to, the following: customer name, address, telephone number; all prepaid loan fees submitted by the customer; amount of loan; application status (i.e. filed, submitted to lenders); scheduled closing date; rate lock status; the location of all original open application files; and a list of applicable wholesale lenders. The latter list should include telephone numbers of contact persons familiar with Gold Reverse's submitted loans; and  The entire loan file for each of the Massachusetts reverse mortgage loans closed by the Corporation.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Gold Reverse shall immediately secure all pending mortgage loan application files and, to the extent that any original documents must be forwarded to the relevant mortgage lender or mortgage broker pursuant to Paragraph 18 of this Temporary Order, a copy of such document, correspondence, or paper relating to the mortgage loan shall be retained in Gold Reverse's books and records and shall be available to the Commissioner, in their entirety, immediately upon request on the date and time specified by the Commissioner.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Temporary Order shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 30A.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such Temporary Order shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from Gold Reverse within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this Temporary Order. If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this Temporary Order shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.  Gold Reverse is hereby notified of the Division's decision pursuant to a letter issued on the date of this Temporary Order, to deny its pending application for approval of its reverse mortgage program.     BY ORDER AND DIRECTION OF THE COMMISSIONER OF BANKS.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE LENDER AND  MORTGAGE BROKER  LICENSING  Docket No. 2008-020  FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  FIRST CALL MORTGAGE COMPANY, INC.  Andover, Massachusetts  Mortgage Company License No(s). MC3198  et al.  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that FIRST CALL MORTGAGE COMPANY, INC., (""First Call Mortgage"" or the ""Corporation""), located at 200 Brickstone Square, Suite 303, Andover, Massachusetts, has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""Temporary Order"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  First Call Mortgage is, and at all relevant times has been, a Massachusetts Corporation doing business in the Commonwealth. First Call Mortgage's main office of record is located at 200 Brickstone Square, Suite 303 Andover, Massachusetts.  First Call Mortgage is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage lender and mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage company license, license number MC3198 to First Call Mortgage to engage in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker on or about October 9, 2003. License number MC3198 authorized First Call Mortgage to conduct the mortgage company business from the Corporation's main office located at 200 Brickstone Square, Andover, Massachusetts.  First Call Mortgage maintains additional office locations from which the Corporation conducts its mortgage broker and mortgage lender business. According to records maintained on file with the Division, First Call Mortgage currently possesses two (2) additional mortgage company licenses from the Commissioner for a location operated in Massachusetts, as well as a location outside the Commonwealth.  Mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers in Massachusetts are licensed and regulated under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, which is administered and enforced by the Commissioner. Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division is authorized to inspect the books, accounts, papers, records, and files of mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers transacting business in Massachusetts to determine compliance with the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E or any rule, or regulation issued thereunder, and with any law, rule, or regulation applicable to the conduct of the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker.  On Monday, July 14, 2008, pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division commenced an examination/inspection of the books, accounts, papers, records, and files maintained by First Call Mortgage to evaluate the Corporation's compliance with the laws, regulations, and regulatory bulletins applicable to the conduct of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker business in Massachusetts (the ""2008 examination/inspection"").  The Division's Report of Examination/Inspection on Consumer Compliance (the ""Report""), which was issued to First Call Mortgage on the effective date of this Temporary Order, presented the findings of the 2008 examination/inspection and alleged significant failures to comply with applicable state and federal laws, rules, regulations, and regulatory bulletins governing the conduct of those engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts. 	 A. Unfair and/or Deceptive Business Practices  Misleading Representations of a Prospective Borrower's Income  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) states: 	 Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1) states, in part: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to make any representation or statement of fact if the representation or statement is false or misleading or has the tendency or capacity to be misleading.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(8), effective as of September, 8, 2006, states: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker of mortgage lender to falsify income or asset information on a mortgage loan application or mortgage loan documents.  The 2008 examination/inspection revealed that First Call Mortgage, had submitted to lenders Uniform Residential Loan Applications (""1003 Form"") in which the applicants' financial information including applicants' gross income differed significantly from the financial information reflected on other pertinent documents including pay stubs and statements of benefit which the Corporation had in its possession. Examples include, but are not limited to the following: 	 Loan No.(s): 8024219503 and 2132876252: 		 Copies of first and second stated loan applications prepared by First Call Mortgage and signed by the borrower on March 8, 2006 for loans which ultimately closed on March 24, 2006, indicated that the borrower, a program project specialist at the United States Air Force, earned approximately $11,500 monthly or $138,000 annually.  A copy of the borrower's Personal Statement of Benefits Form (""Form"") located in the loan file maintained by First Call Mortgage, though obscured by black marker, was legible and listed the annual salary of the borrower as of January 31, 2006 at $57,270.  The discrepancy between the information reflected on the loan applications and the ""blacked out"" Form, reveals that First Call Mortgage overstated the borrower's annual income by approximately $80,730.  Loan No.(s): 681012273 and 681012276: 		 Copies of first and second stated loan applications prepared by First Call Mortgage for loans which ultimately closed on May 17, 2006 indicated that the borrower, a supply manager at the Massachusetts Bay Commuter Railroad Company, LLC, earned approximately $8,833 monthly or $105,996 annually.  A 2004 United States Railroad Retirement Board ""Certificate of Service Months and Compensation"" (""Form"") located in the file maintained by First Call Mortgage reflected the annual creditable compensation for 2001-2004. The highest salary listed was in 2001 and was $40,145.85.  On August 11, 2006, the Division's examiner spoke to a representative at the Railroad Retirement Board who confirmed the information reflected on the Form. The representative indicated that the borrower's income in 2006 was just over $32,000 annually.  The discrepancy between the information reflected on the loan applications and the information received from the representative from the Railroad Retirement Board reveals that First Call Mortgage overstated the borrower's annual income by approximately $73,996.  Land records reviewed by the Division's examiners revealed that the property had subsequently been foreclosed on November 15, 2007.  Loan No.: 206-157053: 		 A copy of a stated loan application prepared by First Call Mortgage for a loan which ultimately closed on March 17, 2006 indicated that the borrower, a human resources specialist at GE Ionics, earned approximately $5,416 monthly or $64,992 annually.  Two copies of pay stubs located in the loan file maintained by First Call Mortgage as of January 15, 2006 and January 29, 2006 respectively reflected a bi-weekly gross income of $2,058.86 or $53,530.36 annually.  The discrepancy between the information reflected on the loan application and the pay stubs located in the loan files maintained by First Call Mortgage reveals that the Corporation overstated the borrower's annual income by approximately $11,461.64.  Loan A (1  st  loan) & Loan No.: 107021609764000: 		 Copies of a first and second stated loan applications prepared by First Call Mortgage for loans which ultimately closed on March 23, 2007 indicated that the borrower, a self-employed contractor, earned $5,341.17 or $64,094 annually and $6,448.00 or $77,376 annually.  In response to the differences in income reflected on both applications, the Corporation indicated that both loans had closed on separate dates, however a review of mortgage records indicated that the first and second loan had closed simultaneously.  First Call Mortgage knew or should have known that financial information submitted on behalf of prospective borrower's to mortgage lenders would determine the mortgage loan product that the borrower ultimately qualified for.  First Call Mortgage knew or should have known that the above referenced income and/or asset information would be relied upon in underwriting the mortgage loan by the mortgage lender or financial institution to which the mortgage loan applications were brokered by First Call Mortgage. 	 B. Misrepresentation to the Division's Examiners  On or around April 9, 2008, while First Call Mortgage was transitioning to the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System (""NMLS""), a centralized licensing system, information reflected on the MU1 indicated that the Corporation offered reverse mortgages. As a result, the Division contacted First Call Mortgage via the NMLS and requested the following clarification: 	 ...Please send an email clarifying whether your company brokers and/or closes reverse mortgages...Please note that mortgage lenders wishing to close or fund reverse mortgages must submit a reverse mortgage program to the Commissioner of Banks for review and be approved prior to offering such a program. This is a requirement for all institutions and companies that wish to offer reverse mortgages, regardless of whether they are licensed or exempt from licensing under the provisions of M.G.L. c. 255E, Section 2, (i.e. a bank, credit union, etc.). The program must include all information requested in the following statutes: M.G.L. c.183, Section 67 and M.G.L. c. 167E, Section 7. Please submit your loan documentation along with your reverse mortgage program....  In response, the Division received an e-mail from the Chief Operating Officer (""COO"") of First Call Mortgage stating the following: ""To clarify we are only brokering reverse mortgages at this time.""  During the 2008 examination/inspection the Division's examiners inquired about First Call Mortgage's reverse mortgage program. The COO e-mailed the Division's examiner and indicated that the Corporation made some reverse mortgage loans for a period of one month.  On September 4, 2008, on at least two occasions, during a discussion with a representative of First Call Mortgage at the Corporation's main office, the Division's examiners inquired if the Corporation had acted in the capacity of a mortgage lender in any reverse mortgage transaction in Massachusetts. In response to the inquiry, the Division's examiners were informed that while First Call Mortgage had table funded loans over a one month period, those reverse mortgage loans did not involve residential property located in Massachusetts. Upon reviewing their records, the Corporation reiterated that First Call had not made any reverse mortgage loans in Massachusetts.  The Division's examiners thereafter conducted a review of mortgage deeds recorded at the Southern Middlesex Registry of Deeds through  www.masslandrecords.com  and discovered that First Call Mortgage had table funded at least one reverse mortgage loan during June 2008.  The Division's examiners immediately notified the Corporation's representative who thereafter indicated that First Call Mortgage had table funded reverse mortgage loans through a national reverse mortgage lender.  In response, the Division's examiners requested a year to date loan list of all reverse mortgage loan transactions brokered or made by the Corporation. A review of the loan list indicated that First Call Mortgage acted in the capacity of a mortgage lender in at least six reverse mortgage loans on residential property located in Massachusetts over a period of five months. 	 C. Violation of Massachusetts Reverse Mortgage Statutory Requirements  Making Reverse Mortgage Loans without Approval  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 14 through 20 of this Temporary Order, First Call Mortgage, was notified by the Division, that Massachusetts law requires mortgagees intending to make reverse mortgage loans to submit for the Division's approval, a program which meets specific criteria set forth in Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 167E, section 7, and made applicable to mortgagees through Massachusetts General Laws chapter 183, section 67.  Books and Records reviewed by the Division's examiners revealed that First Call Mortgage had made at least six reverse mortgage loans on residential property located in the Commonwealth without receiving approval. 	 Failure to Demonstrate Compliance with Massachusetts Borrower Protections in Reverse Mortgage Transactions  General Laws, chapter 167E, section 7(d)(2), made applicable to all mortgagees by General Laws, chapter 183, section 67 states: 	 The commissioner shall not approve a program for reverse mortgage loans which does not include the following:-  	(2) an applicant for the loan shall not be bound for 7 days after his acceptance, in writing, of the lender's written commitment to make the loan.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection indicated that First Call Mortgage failed to retain sufficient evidence in at least two loan files to demonstrate that the borrower's were afforded the seven day cooling off period subsequent to the acceptance of the Corporation's commitment to make the loan. 	 Failure to Document a Prospective Borrower's Completion of Mandatory Counseling with an Approved Agency  General Laws, chapter 167E, section 7(e), made applicable to all mortgagees by General Laws, chapter 183, section 67 states: 	 A bank shall not make a reverse mortgage loan as provided in this section until it has received a notice, in writing, that the prospective borrower has completed a reverse mortgage counseling program which has been approved by the executive office of elder affairs and which shall include instruction on reverse mortgage loans. The counseling program shall include, but is not limited to...  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection indicated that First Call Mortgage failed to retain evidence in the loan file maintained by the Corporation, documenting that a reverse mortgage borrower had completed the mandatory counseling program and that the program had been approved by the Executive Office of Elder Affairs. 	 D. Issuance of Mortgage Loan Rate Lock Agreements  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(3) states, in part: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker to issue a mortgage loan rate lock commitment on its own behalf or on behalf of a mortgage lender, or to imply to a consumer that it can lock a rate on behalf of the consumer. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit a mortgage broker from taking a rate lock commitment fee for transmittal to a mortgage lender prior to the issuance by the mortgage lender of a commitment or approval, provided that prior to the taking of a rate lock commitment fee:  (a) the mortgage broker provides the consumer with a mortgage loan rate lock commitment from the mortgage lender which intends to make the loan, which conforms with the requirements of 209 CMR 42.11A; and  (b) the rate lock commitment fee is made payable by the consumer to the mortgage lender which intends to make the loan. A mortgage broker may only take a rate lock commitment fee for transmittal to the mortgage lender which intends to make the loan. Nothing herein shall prohibit a mortgage broker from negotiating the terms or conditions of a mortgage loan, including the interest rate, on behalf of a consumer. A mortgage broker may also use such forms or other evidence as desired to allow a consumer to indicate a preference to enter into a mortgage rate lock commitment with a mortgage lender. However, any such forms or evidence must clearly and conspicuously contain the following statement: ""This is a request, not a commitment, to lock your interest rate with a mortgage lender"".  The 2008 examination/inspection revealed that when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker, First Call Mortgage provided consumers with a ""Rate Lock Form"" on the Corporation's letterhead, which implied that First Call Mortgage could lock an interest rate on behalf of the consumer. The language in the Form gave a prospective borrower the option of floating or locking in a rate and did not contain the statement indicating that the Form was merely a request and not a commitment to lock in the rate with a mortgage lender. 	 E. Providing Mortgage Lender Disclosures to Consumers When Acting in the Capacity of a Mortgage Broker  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 183, section 28C(a) states in part: 	 A lender shall not knowingly make a home loan if the home loan pays off all or part of an existing home loan that was consummated within the prior 60 months or other debt of the borrower, unless the refinancing is in the borrower's interest. The ""borrower's interest"" shall be narrowly construed, and the burden is upon the lender to determine that the refinancing is in the borrower's interest.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 53.07(1)(b) states in part: 	 A lender may request that a borrower acknowledge receipt of such a worksheet or other documentation; provided, however, a lender shall not shift the burden to the borrower to demonstrate that a home loan is in the borrowers' interest.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker, First Call Mortgage provided consumers with a ""Net Tangible Benefit Disclosure and Acknowledgement"" (""Form"") on the Corporation's letterhead. It has been the Division's longstanding position that the determination of the borrower's interest is the lender's responsibility and the burden should not be shifted to the borrower or made by a mortgage broker. By distributing the Form to prospective borrower's on the Corporation's letterhead when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker, First Call Mortgage exceeded its authority as a mortgage broker and distributed a form which appeared to shift the burden to the borrower.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection indicate that First Call Mortgage, when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker, routinely provided several mortgage lender disclosures to consumers in violation of and exceeding its authority under G. L. c. 255E.  The mortgage lender disclosures include, but are not limited to, Equal Credit Opportunity Notices, Servicing Disclosure Statements, Truth in Lending Statements and Pre-Approval Letters. 	 F. Failure to Provide the Division Required Notice of Significant Events  Failure to Provide Notice of Change in Ownership  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12(3)(a) states: 	 15 days prior to any proposed change in control in the ownership of a Licensee, or among the officers, partners or directors of a Licensee, a notice shall forthwith be filed with the Commissioner who may thereupon cause such investigation to be made as he deems necessary, as if it were a new license. In the case of a corporation, control is defined as a change of ownership by a person or group acting in concert to acquire ten percent of the stock, or the ability of a person or group acting in concert to elect a majority of the directors or otherwise effect a change in policy of the corporation.  Books and records reviewed during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that First Call failed to provide fifteen days prior notice of a change in control in the ownership of the Corporation. Specifically, on August 27, 2007, Carl McFadden sold a 50% interest in the Corporation to two outside owners. As a result, the Division was unable to determine if an investigation may have been necessary.  The Division's records on the NMLS indicate that First Call Mortgage attempted to modify the ownership status on August 27, 2008, approximately one year after the transfer of interest. 	 G. Failure to Properly Maintain Books and Records  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.09(1)(b) states: 	 Each Licensee shall keep and use its books, records and accounts in a manner which will allow the Commissioner to determine whether the Licensee is complying with the provisions of M.G.L. c. 255E and applicable state and federal laws and regulations. Each Licensee shall comply with the provisions of 209 CMR 48.00...  (b) The mortgage broker ... shall retain for a minimum of three years after a mortgage loan is made the following: the original loan origination and compensation agreement as set out in 209 CMR 42.16; a copy of the settlement statement; an account of fees received in connection with the loan; correspondence; papers or records relating to the loan; and such other documents as the Commissioner may require.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection indicated that First Call Mortgage failed to retain sufficient documentation to enable the Commissioner to determine whether the Corporation was complying with certain laws and regulations governing mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers in Massachusetts, including but not limited to, compliance with mandated timing requirements. In at least three loan files reviewed, First Call Mortgage failed to retain sufficient documentation to enable the Division's examiners to determine that an Attorney General's Mortgage Broker disclosure was provided. In addition, copies of Good Faith Estimate Disclosures and Loan Origination and Compensation Agreements (""Disclosures"") noted dates that were prior to the date of application. 	 H. Misleading Statements  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1) states, in part: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to make any representation or statement of fact if the representation or statement is false or misleading, or has the tendency or capacity to be misleading.  Books and records reviewed during the 2008 examination revealed that when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker, First Call Mortgage provided applicants with a Borrower's Certification and Authorization Form that contained language that was false or misleading or had the tendency or capacity to be false or misleading. Specifically, the Borrower's Certification and Authorization Form contained language which presented the appearance that First Call Mortgage, was approving or funding the mortgage loan by indicating that the Corporation would be able to sell the mortgage loan to an investor. 	 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 40, First Call Mortgage has failed to demonstrate and maintain the character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the mortgage lender and mortgage broker business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulations 209 CMR 42.03(2)(c) and 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 40, by falsifying borrowers' income information on Uniform Residential Loan Applications submitted in connection with residential mortgage transactions, First Call Mortgage has violated the Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a), the Office of the Attorney General's implementing regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1) the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(8).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 40, by making reverse mortgage loans prior to obtaining approval from the Division, First Call Mortgage violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 167E, section 7, applicable to all mortgagees by Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 183, section 67.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 40, by failing to provide documentation indicating that reverse mortgage borrowers were afforded a seven day cooling off period prior to settlement, First Call Mortgage violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 167E, section 7(d)(2), applicable to all mortgagees by Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 183, section 67.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 40, by failing to ensure that consumers who obtained reverse mortgage loans were counseled through an agency approved by the Executive Office of Elder Affairs, when acting in the capacity of a mortgage lender, First Call Mortgage violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 167E, section 7(e), applicable to all mortgagees by Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 183, section 67.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 40, by providing consumers with written documentation that stated or implied that the Corporation was able to lock mortgage rates on behalf of the consumer, when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker, First Call Mortgage violated the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(3).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 40, by providing disclosures to consumers that only lenders are authorized to provide when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker, First Call Mortgage has violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 40, by failing to notify the Commissioner, in writing, at least fifteen days prior to a change in ownership, First Call Mortgage violated the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12(3)(b).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 40, by failing to keep and use its books and records in a manner which would allow the Commissioner to determine whether the Corporation was complying with state and federal laws and regulations, First Call Mortgage has violated the Division's regulations 209 CMR 42.09(1) and 209 CMR 48.03.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 40, by providing disclosures to consumers that contained language that was false or misleading or had the tendency or capacity to be false or misleading, when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker, First Call Mortgage is in violation of the Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 40, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 First Call Mortgage has engaged in, is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that it is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker including, but not limited to, Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00 et seq.; and  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to First Call Mortgage.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 40, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of First Call Mortgage's original mortgage lender and mortgage broker license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 40 present sufficient grounds for the revocation of First Call Mortgage's mortgage lender and mortgage broker licenses pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.04(2)(b), 42.07(2)(b), and 42.12A(19). 	 ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that First Call Mortgage and any and all officers, members, managers, employees, independent contractors, or agents, operating on behalf of First Call Mortgage, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of: (a) a mortgage lender and mortgage broker, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, and (b) a mortgage loan originator, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Temporary Order. Therefore, First Call Mortgage is ordered to immediately cease soliciting or accepting, either directly or indirectly, any residential mortgage loan applications from consumers for residential property located in Massachusetts.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that First Call Mortgage, shall immediately place any fees previously collected from Massachusetts consumers relative to any pending mortgage loan applications in a separate escrow account maintained at a federally insured bank.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that First Call Mortgage shall immediately place with one or more qualified broker(s) or lender(s), as appropriate based on the status of the application and with no loss to applicants, all of its pending Massachusetts residential mortgage loan applications. It being understood that ""no loss to the applicant"" shall mean that any loan which may have been closed by First Call Mortgage and remains unfunded, as well as any pending application which has been approved by the Corporation but has not yet closed, shall be placed to a lender willing to fund, or close, the mortgage loan under the same terms and conditions extended by First Call Mortgage. In the event that no such placement can be made, First Call Mortgage shall either independently fund the mortgage loan under such terms and conditions or buy down the mortgage loan offered by the lender so that the applicant does not incur a loss as a result of such placement. First Call Mortgage shall obtain the prior approval of the Commissioner before placing such applications to the qualified lender(s) or broker(s) as appropriate.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that as soon as possible, but in no event later than two days after the effective date of this Temporary Order, First Call Mortgage shall submit the following information in writing to the Commissioner: 	 A detailed record of all pending residential mortgage loan applications, from both the Corporation's lending and its brokering operations, which shall include, but is not limited to, the following: customer name, address, telephone number; all prepaid loan fees submitted by the customer; amount of loan; application status (i.e. filed, submitted to lenders); scheduled closing date; rate lock status; the location of all original open application files; and a list of applicable wholesale lenders. The latter list should include telephone numbers of contact persons familiar with First Call Mortgage's submitted loans.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that First Call Mortgage shall immediately secure all pending mortgage loan application files and, to the extent that any original documents must be forwarded to the relevant mortgage lender or mortgage broker pursuant to Paragraph 56 of this Temporary Order, a copy of such document, correspondence, or paper relating to the mortgage loan shall be retained in First Call Mortgage's books and records and shall be available to the Commissioner, in their entirety, immediately upon request on the date and time specified by the Commissioner.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Temporary Order shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 30A.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such Temporary Order shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from First Call Mortgage within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this Temporary Order.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE BROKER  LICENSING  Docket No. 2008-022  FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  AMERICAN ADVISORS GROUP  Irvine, California  Mortgage Broker License No. MB5106  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that AMERICAN ADVISORS GROUP (""American Advisors"" or the ""Corporation""), located at 16811 Hale Avenue, Irvine, California has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""Temporary Order"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  American Advisors is, and at all relevant times, has been a foreign corporation conducting business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. American Advisors' main office is located at 16811 Hale Avenue, Irvine, California.  American Advisors is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage broker license, license number MB5106 to American Advisors to engage in the business of a mortgage broker on or about May 20, 2008. License number MB5106 authorized American Advisors to conduct its mortgage broker business from the Corporation's main office located at 16811 Hale Avenue, Irvine, California  On September 11, 2008, the Division was forwarded a copy of a reverse mortgage loan solicitation (""Solicitation"") received by a Massachusetts consumer from American Advisors. A copy of the solicitation is attached as Exhibit 1.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) states: 	 Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1) states, in part: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to make any representation or statement of fact if the representation or statement is false or misleading or has the tendency or capacity to be misleading.  The Solicitation, marked as an ""URGENT NOTICE,"" includes several references which collectively create an appearance that the Solicitation was issued by a government agency. Specifically, the Solicitation noted that the mailing was forwarded from ""ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES, and included an Equal Housing Opportunity logo which was located adjacent thereto, as well as a reference to a property identification number. The Solicitation also contained the following heading: ""Notice of 2008 Government Benefits."" The body of the Solicitation referenced a case number and indicated that the consumer had been ""pre-selected"" to participate in a government backed program, with consumer funds ""available now.""  Language indicating that the offer was not being offered by a government agency was included in the Solicitation, notwithstanding the representations identified above which indicate a government affiliation. However, such language was in a font size that was significantly smaller then that in the body of the Solicitation and was located in a non-prominent location at the bottom of the Solicitation.  American Advisors is not affiliated with any government agency. Reza Jahangiri is the sole owner and officer of American Advisors.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(9) states: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker to make false promises to influence, persuade or induce a consumer to sign a mortgage loan application or mortgage loan documents.  The Solicitation stated a specific monthly disbursement amount, as well as a lump sum draw and credit amounts that the consumer would be entitled to receive. The Solicitation failed to note that the proceeds that were set forth in the Solicitation would be affected by an appraisal of the property as well as ancillary costs associated with obtaining a reverse mortgage including closing costs, mortgage insurance premiums and monthly servicing fees. Moreover, the Solicitation imposed a time-frame in which the consumer was required to respond to the offer which creates the impression that the consumer must take prompt action in order to benefit from the ""program.""  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(4) states: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker to advertise any interest rate or loan term described in 209 CMR 32.24(3)(a) in any media without the following statement: ""We arrange but do not make loans"". No advertisement by a mortgage broker in any media shall contain language which indicates or suggests that the mortgage broker will fund or approve a mortgage loan or guarantee any rate.  The Solicitation indicates that the consumer to whom the Solicitation was mailed could receive monthly disbursements in the amount of $1,789.59 with $249,279.11 available with a credit line growth rate of 5.3%. The maximum lending limit is identified as $362,790.00. The Solicitation does not include the statement, ""We arrange but do not make loans"" as required pursuant to 209 CMR 42.12A(4).  The Solicitation further noted that the consumer would have to contact an ""authorized lender"" by September 12, 2008 in order to receive additional information and identifies American Advisors as the authorized lender above the Corporation's toll free number which is designated as the contact number.  American Advisors is not licensed by the Commissioner to conduct business as a mortgage lender in Massachusetts under M.G.L. chapter 255E, section 2 and the Division's regulation 209 42.00  et seq . 	 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 15, American Advisors has failed to demonstrate and maintain the character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the mortgage broker business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 15, by mailing Massachusetts consumers a Solicitation containing false or misleading language or language that had the tendency to be false or misleading, including language that could lead the reader to believe that the Solicitation was issued by a government agency, American Advisors has violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a), and the Office of the Attorney General's implementing regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 15, by mailing Massachusetts consumers a Solicitation containing language that gave the impression that American Advisors was authorized to operate as a licensed mortgage lender in Massachusetts, the Corporation violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2 and the Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 15, by mailing Massachusetts consumers a Solicitation that made false promises to influence, persuade or induce a consumer to sign a mortgage loan application including references to specific monthly and lump sum payments that do not take into account the appraisal of the property and other ancillary costs associated with obtaining a reverse mortgage loan, and by imposing a time-frame in which consumers were required to respond to the offer, American Advisors violated the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(9)  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 15, by mailing Massachusetts consumers a Solicitation referencing loan terms without including the statement, ""We arrange but do not make loans,"" American Advisors has violated the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(4).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 15, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 American Advisors has engaged in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that the Corporation is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage broker including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00 et seq.  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to American Advisors.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 15, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of American Advisors original mortgage broker license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.07(2)(b). Further, the facts and conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 15, present sufficient grounds for the revocation of American Advisors broker license pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 and the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.07(2)(b) and 209 CMR 42.12A(19). 	 ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that American Advisors and any and all officers, members, managers, employees, independent contractors, or agents, operating on behalf of American Advisors, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of: (a) a mortgage broker, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, (b) a mortgage loan originator, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Temporary Order. Therefore, American Advisors is ordered to immediately cease soliciting or accepting, either directly or indirectly, any residential mortgage loan applications from consumers for residential property located in Massachusetts.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, that American Advisors shall cease distributing or publishing any advertising materials, including the Solicitation, to Massachusetts consumers. In addition, American Advisors shall submit to the Commissioner a detailed record, prepared as of the date of submission, of all Massachusetts consumers to whom the Corporation distributed the Solicitation. The records to be produced shall be submitted to the Commissioner within five (5) days of the effective date of this Temporary Order and shall include the consumers' names and addresses.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, that American Advisors shall immediately place any fees previously collected from Massachusetts consumers, relative to any pending mortgage loan applications accepted at any office location, into a separate escrow account, designated for such purpose and maintained at a federally insured bank. In addition, American Advisors shall adopt or revise, as applicable, policies and procedures to ensure adherence to all regulations concerning the maintenance of such escrow account under 209 CMR 42.11.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that American Advisors shall immediately place with one or more qualified broker(s) or lender(s), as appropriate based on the status of the application and with no loss to applicants, all of its pending Massachusetts residential mortgage loan applications. American Advisors shall obtain the prior approval of the Commissioner before placing such applications to the qualified broker(s) or lender(s).  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that American Advisors shall submit to the Commissioner a detailed record, prepared as of the date of submission, of all of the Corporation's pending residential mortgage loan applications on property located in Massachusetts. The records to be produced shall be submitted to the Commissioner within five (5) days of the effective date of this Temporary Order and shall include all information on file, regarding the Corporation's open application list, including but not necessarily limited to, the following: 	 All information on file as of the date of submission regarding American Advisors' open application list as a mortgage broker, including but not limited to, the following: The names of all individuals from whom American Advisors has accepted an application for a residential mortgage loan; the applicants' addresses and telephone numbers; the amount of all prepaid loan fees submitted by the customer; the amount of each loan; application status (i.e. filed, submitted to lenders, cleared to close, etc.); scheduled closing dates; rate lock status; and a list identifying the applicable broker or lender with whom the applicants' application was placed. The latter list should include telephone numbers of contact persons familiar with the Corporation's submitted loans.  American Advisors shall immediately secure all pending residential mortgage loan application files and, to the extent that any original documents must be forwarded to the relevant mortgage lender(s) and or mortgage broker(s) pursuant to Paragraph 27 of this Temporary Order, a copy of such document, correspondence, or paper relating to the mortgage loan shall be retained in American Advisors' books and records and shall be available to the Commissioner, in their entirety, upon request.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Temporary Order shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under General Laws chapter 30A.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such Temporary Order shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from American Advisors within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this Temporary Order. If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this Temporary Order shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.     BY ORDER AND DIRECTION OF THE COMMISSIONER OF BANKS.

FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons engaged in the business of a foreign transmittal agency pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169.  Paulo DeOliveira, Valdeci DeOliveira and Silvan DeOliveira individually and collectively, are the owners/officers of V & P Enterprises LTD D/B/A Armazen (the ""Corporation""), located at 511 Medford Street, Somerville, Massachusetts.

On August 16, 2007, Armazen's foreign transmittal agency license number FT5260 was surrendered in accordance with Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169, section 3.  Neither Paulo DeOliveira, Valdeci DeOliveira, Silvan DeOliveira nor Armazen have applied or have obtained a license from the Commissioner pursuant to General Laws chapter 169, section 3, to engage in the activity of a foreign transmittal agency at 511 Medford Street, Somerville, Massachusetts. The storefront of Armazen located at 511 Medford Street, Somerville continues to advertise the foreign transmittal agency services of Uno Remittance.  The Division has reason to believe that Paulo DeOliveira, Valdeci DeOliveira, Silvan DeOliveira, and Armazen continue to engage in the activity of a foreign transmittal agency at 511 Medford Street, Somerville, Massachusetts, in violation of General Laws chapter 169, section 3.

The Bank shall submit the program, and any future modifications, to the Area Director and the Commissioner for review and comment. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of all such comments from the Area Director or the Commissioner, and after incorporation and adoption of any required changes, the Bank shall approve the revised program, which approval shall be recorded in the minutes of the meeting of the Board.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  FOREIGN TRANSMITTAL  AGENCY LICENSING  Docket No. 2008-014  FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  ESPIRITO SANTO E COMERCIAL  DE LISBOA, INC.  Newark, New Jersey  Foreign Transmittal Agency License No. FT 1349  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that ESPIRITO SANTO E COMERCIAL DE LISBOA, INC., located at 73-75 Ferry Street, Newark, New Jersey (""Espirito Santo"" or the ""Corporation"") has engaged, or is engaged in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169, and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 44.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST pursuant to General Laws chapter 169, section 13(b).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons engaged in the business of a foreign transmittal agency pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169.  Espirito Santo is, and at all relevant times has been, a foreign corporation conducting business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Espirito Santo's main office is located at 73-75 Ferry Street, Newark, New Jersey.  Espirito Santo is licensed by the Commissioner as a foreign transmittal agency under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a foreign transmittal license to Espirito Santo on or about September 3, 1997, with license number FT1349. License number FT1349 authorized Espirito Santo to operate as a foreign transmittal agency at 1351 Acushnet Avenue, New Bedford, Massachusetts.  By letter from Antonio Gato, President and CEO of Espirito Santo and received by the Division on or about July 3, 2007, Espirito Santo notified the Division that the Corporation was closing its office at 1351 Acushnet Avenue, New Bedford, effective July 15, 2007. In the letter, Mr. Gato requested that the license be ""relocated"" to its main office in Newark, New Jersey to keep the license active because it was his intention to open another office location in Massachusetts at a future date. Espirito Santo thereafter returned its original license certificate to the Division and on July 11, 2007 the Division reissued license FT1349, authorizing Espirito Santo to conduct business at its main office location at 73-75 Ferry Street, Newark, New Jersey.  Espirito Santo filed an application for renewal on or about May 19, 2008. As of the date of this Temporary Order, the Division has not made a determination on the license renewal application.  Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169, section 10, the Division conducted an inspection of the books, accounts, papers, records, and files of Espirito Santo on October 9, 2007 (the ""examination/inspection"").  The Division's Report of Examination/Inspection (the ""Report""), which was issued to Espirito Santo on the effective date of this Temporary Order, presented the findings of the 2007 examination/inspection and alleged significant failures to comply with applicable state and federal laws, rules, regulations, and regulatory bulletins governing the conduct of those engaged in the business of a foreign transmittal agency in Massachusetts. 	 A. Failure to File Suspicious Activity Reports  The Bank Secrecy Act's (BSA's) (31 U.S.C. § 5311  et seq .) implementing regulation at 31 CFR § 103.20(a)(1) states, in part: 	 Every money services business . . . shall file with the Treasury Department, to the extent and in the manner required by this section, a report of any suspicious transaction relevant to a possible violation of law or regulation . . .  The BSA's implementing regulation at 31 CFR § 103.20(a)(2) states, in part: 	 A transaction requires reporting under the terms of this section if it is conducted or attempted by, at, or through a money services business, involves or aggregates funds or other assets of at least $2,000… and the money services business knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect that the transaction (or a pattern of transactions of which the transaction is a part):… (ii) Is designed, whether through structuring or other means, to evade any requirements of this part or of any other regulations promulgated under the Bank Secrecy Act, Public Law 91-508, as amended, codified at 12 U.S.C. 1829b, 12 U.S.C. 1951-1959, and 31 U.S.C. 5311- 5330; or (iii) Serves no business or apparent lawful purpose, and the reporting money services business knows of no reasonable explanation for the transaction after examining the available facts, including the background and possible purpose of the transaction. (iv) Involves use of the money service business to facilitate criminal activity.  The examination/inspection revealed that Espirito Santo did not file any Suspicious Activity Reports by Money Services Business (""SAR-MSBs"") for transactions conducted in Massachusetts for the period July 2006 to July 2007. However, the Division's examiners identified 28 transactions totaling over $450,000 that Espirito Santo should have known, suspected or had reason to suspect were suspicious. Specifically, the Corporation should have had reason to suspect that the transactions were designed to evade the reporting requirements of the BSA. The transactions identified by the examiners are specifically set forth in the Report and are incorporated herein by reference. 	 B. Failure to Implement an Effective Anti-Money Laundering Program  The BSA's implementing regulation at 31 C.F.R. § 103.125 states, in part: 	 Each money services business . . . shall develop, implement and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program . . . . that is reasonably designed to prevent the money services business from being used to facilitate money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities.  The program shall be commensurate with the risks posed by the location and size of, and the nature and volume of the financial services provided by, the money services business.  The BSA's implementing regulation at 31 C.F.R. § 103.125(d) requires that money services businesses implement written anti-money laundering policies and procedures that, at a minimum: (1) incorporate policies and procedures and internal controls reasonably designed to assure compliance with this part, including requirements verifying customer identification, filing reports, creating and retaining records, and responding to law enforcement requests; (2) designate a person to assure day to day compliance with the program; (3) provide for education and/or training of appropriate personnel, including training in the detection of suspicious transactions; and (4) provide for independent review to monitor and maintain an adequate program. 	 (i) Policies, Procedures and Internal Controls  Books and records reviewed during the examination/inspection revealed that Espirito Santo's written anti-money laundering manual either did not include requirements for verifying customer identification, responding to law enforcement requests, or providing for independent audits. The portions of the manual addressing requirements for filing of reports, creating and retaining records, and training of personnel are insufficiently documented in the manual.  The examination/inspection revealed that Espirito Santo's policies, procedures, and internal controls were insufficient to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and were not commensurate with the volume, dollar amounts, geographical reach and nature of the transactions processed by the Corporation, as more specifically enumerated in this Temporary Order and in the Examiner's Comments and Conclusions section of the Report. 	 (ii) Designated Compliance Officer  The BSA's implementing regulation at 31 C.F.R. 103.125(d)(2) states, in part: 	 [The money services business' anti-money laundering program shall] [d]esignate a person to assure day to day compliance with the program and this part. The responsibilities of such person shall include assuring that: (i) The money services business properly files reports, and creates and retains records, in accordance with applicable requirements of this part; (ii) The compliance program is updated as necessary to reflect current requirements of this part, and related guidance issued by the Department of the Treasury; and (iii) The money services business provides appropriate training and education in accordance with paragraph (d)(3) of this section.  Espirito Santo has designated a compliance officer; however, the examination/inspection revealed that the compliance officer failed to effectively perform the required duties and appeared to lack the skills and knowledge necessary for that position. Specifically, as explained in more detail in this Temporary Order and in the Examiner's Comments and Conclusions section of the Report, the compliance officer failed to ensure that Espirito Santo properly identified suspicious transactions that would require the filing of SAR-MSBs under 31 C.F.R. § 103.20 and failed to ensure that the Corporation properly filed Currency Transaction Reports as required pursuant to 31 C.F.R. § 103.22. 	 (iii) Education and Training  The BSA's implementing regulation at 103 C.F.R. § 103.125(d)(3) states: 	 [The money services business' anti-money laundering program shall] [p]rovide education and/or training of appropriate personnel concerning their responsibilities under the program, including training in the detection of suspicious transactions to the extent that the money services business is required to report such transactions under this part.  Espirito Santo's training manual briefly sets out training and education requirements for new hires and ongoing training for employees. Because the New Bedford office was closed at the time of the examination/inspection, the Division's examiners were unable to question Espirito Santo's employees to ascertain their knowledge of their responsibilities under an anti-money laundering program. However, the examination/inspection revealed that, in practice, the training program evidently did not effectively ensure that all personnel were adequately trained to identify and report suspicious transactions pursuant to 31 C.F.R. 103.20, as evidenced by the Corporation's failure to file SAR-MSBs when required and more specifically explained in this Temporary Order and in the Examiner's Comments and Conclusions section of the Report. 	 (iv) Independent Review  The BSA's implementing regulation at 31 C.F.R. § 103.125(d)(4) states: 	 [The money services business' anti-money laundering program shall] [p]rovide for independent review to monitor and maintain an adequate program. The scope and frequency of the review shall be commensurate with the risk of the financial services provided by the money services business. Such review may be conducted by an officer or employee of the money services business so long as the reviewer is not the person designated in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.  The examination/inspection revealed that Espirito Santo's independent review was ineffective and not commensurate with the risk of the financial services provided by the Corporation. The audit was conducted by the Corporation's parent company, Banco Espirito Santo, Lisbon Portugal. Banco Espirito conducted its review in 2006 but did not conduct an on-site assessment of the Corporation's anti-money laundering program at the New Bedford location. There is no evidence that the review evaluated Espirito Santo's policies and procedures for identifying suspicious transactions as required by 31 C.F.R. § 103.20. Moreover, the audit failed to identify easily recognizable weaknesses in the compliance program such as failure to develop, implement and maintain a written anti-money laundering program that fully complies with 31 C.F.R. § 103.125. 	 C. Failure to PROPERLY File Currency Transaction Reports  The BSA's implementing regulation at 31 C.F.R. § 103.22(b)(1) states, in part: 	 Each financial institution other than a casino shall file a report of each deposit, withdrawal, exchange of currency or other payment or transfer, by, through, or to such financial institution which involves a transaction in currency of more than $10,000 . . .  The BSA's implementing regulation at 31 C.F.R. § 103.27(a)(1) states: 	 A report required by § 103.22(a) shall be filed by the financial institution within 15 days following the day on which the reportable transaction occurred.  Books and records reviewed during the examination/inspection revealed that the Corporation filed only one currency transaction report (""CTR"") during the period of July 2006 to July 2007. The aforementioned CTR's filing date was January 12, 2006 [  sic ] for a transaction conducted on December 16, 2006, exceeding the 15 day time limit. In addition, Part III of the CTR did not include the regulator number. 	 D. Failure to Comply with Certain of the Division's Regulations  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 44.07(3) states: 	 The Licensee [foreign transmittal agency] shall maintain complete and accurate trust account records. The Licensee shall produce, upon request, all documents pertaining to trust account activity, including, but not limited to, bank statements, check stubs, canceled, voided or unused checks, deposit tickets, and reconciliations or other comparable account records.  During the examination/inspection, the Division's examiners requested account statements pertaining to the Corporation's trust account. Espirito Santo was unable to produce adequate account statements in response to the examiners' request because the accounts were maintained and held by its parent company, Banco Espirito Santo.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 44.10(3) states, in part: 	 Grounds for license revocation under M.G.L. c. 169, § 12 and the issuance of cease and desist orders under M.G.L. c. 169, § 13 shall include, but are not limited to, the following prohibited acts and practices by Licensees [foreign transmittal agencies]: . . . 3) failing to disclose the type and number of its license(s) to all clients in writing at the time deposits for transmittal abroad are accepted or to fail to disclose the type and number of its license(s) in all advertisements.  Espirito Santo failed to disclose its license type and number on its website,  www.espiritosanto.us . 	 Conclusions of Law  Based on the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 27, Espirito Santo has failed to demonstrate the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the business will operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169, section 6 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 44.03.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 though 27, Espirito Santo failed to properly file SAR-MSBs, in violation of 31 C.F.R. § 103.20.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 though 27, Espirito Santo failed to implement an effective anti-money laundering program commensurate with the risks posed by the location and size of, and nature and volume of the financial services provided by the Corporation, in violation of 31 C.F.R. § 103.125.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 though 27, Espirito Santo failed to properly file CTRs, in violation of 31 C.F.R. §§ 103.22 and 103.27.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 27, Espirito Santo failed to produce complete trust account records, in violation of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 44.07(3).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 though 27, Espirito Santo failed to disclose the type and number of its license on its website, in violation of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 44.10(3).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 27, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 Espirito Santo has engaged, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that the Corporation is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a foreign transmittal agency including, but not limited to, the provisions under General Laws chapter 169 and the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 44.00  et seq .  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to Espirito Santo.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 27, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of Espirito Santo's original foreign transmittal agency license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE BROKER AND  MORTGAGE LENDER  LICENSING  Docket No. 2009-001  FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  BAY MORTGAGE SERVICES, INC.  Plymouth, Massachusetts  Mortgage Company License No. MC1419  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that BAY MORTGAGE SERVICES, INC., (""Bay Mortgage"" or the ""Corporation""), located at 2277 State Road, Plymouth, Massachusetts, has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, the Division's regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , and other statutes and regulations applicable to the mortgage business, hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""Temporary Order"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  Bay Mortgage is, and at all relevant times has been, a Massachusetts corporation doing business in the Commonwealth. Bay Mortgage's main office is located at 2277 State Road, Plymouth, Massachusetts.  According to the Division's records, Peter Lucido is the President and sole shareholder of Bay Mortgage.  Bay Mortgage is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage lender and mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage broker license to Bay Mortgage to engage in the business of a mortgage broker in Massachusetts on or about January 2, 1992. On or about January 2, 1992, the Commissioner issued a mortgage lender license to Bay Mortgage to engage in the business of a mortgage lender in Massachusetts. On July 27, 2000, the Commissioner issued a consolidated mortgage lender and mortgage broker license to the Corporation, with license number MC1419. License number MC1419 authorized Bay Mortgage to conduct the mortgage company business from the Corporation's main office located at 2277 State Road, Plymouth Massachusetts.  At the time of the examination/inspection, Bay Mortgage maintained an additional licensed office location at 730 Hancock Street, Quincy, Massachusetts from which the Corporation conducted its mortgage lender and mortgage broker business. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner issued a mortgage company license, license number MC3073, to Bay Mortgage for that location on or about June 10, 2003. (On or around August 28, 2008, the Division received notification from Bay Mortgage of the Corporation's intention to surrender license number MC3073, associated with the Quincy branch location.)  Mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers in Massachusetts are licensed and regulated under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, which is administered and enforced by the Commissioner. Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division is authorized to inspect the books, accounts, papers, records, and files of mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers transacting business in Massachusetts to determine compliance with the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E or any rule, or regulation issued thereunder, and with any law, rule, or regulation applicable to the conduct of the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker.  On August 12, 2008, pursuant to the authority granted under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division commenced an examination/inspection of the books, accounts, papers, records, and files maintained by Bay Mortgage (the ""2008 examination/inspection""). The 2008 examination/inspection was conducted on-site at the Corporation's main office in Plymouth, Massachusetts.  The Division's Report of Examination/Inspection on Consumer Compliance (the ""Report""), which was issued to Bay Mortgage on the effective date of this Temporary Order, presented the findings of the 2008 examination/inspection and alleged significant failures to comply with applicable state and federal laws, rules, regulations, and regulatory bulletins governing the conduct of those engaged in the business of a mortgage broker and mortgage lender in Massachusetts. 	 A. Failure to Meet Net Worth Requirements  Pursuant to the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.03(2)(a), as applicable to Bay Mortgage (Pursuant to the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.17, mortgage lenders and brokers are required to demonstrate compliance with amendments to 209 CMR 42.03 by December 31, 2008. The cited language included in this Paragraph of the Temporary Order is reproduced from the Division's regulation as it existed prior to the regulatory amendments, thus representing the requirements applicable to Bay Mortgage at the time of the 2008 examination/inspection.): 	 (2)(a)... An Applicant shall demonstrate and maintain:  	1. a net worth of not less than $100,000; or  	2. a combination of a net worth of not less than $ 25,000 and a bond of up to $ 75,000 in such form and with such sureties as may be approved by the Commissioner, provided such net worth and bond in the aggregate equal or exceed $ 100,000.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that, after adjusting Bay Mortgage's capital position in accordance with the definition of ""net worth"" under 209 CMR 42.02, Bay Mortgage reported a negative net worth position of ($144,000).  At the time of the 2008 Examination/Inspection, Bay Mortgage maintained a surety bond in the amount of $75,000 to supplement the net worth position.  However, even after accounting for the surety bond, Bay Mortgage continued to reflect a net worth deficiency of ($69,000). 	 B. Unfair or Deceptive Acts and Practices a. False and/or Misleading Representations of Prospective Borrowers' Income  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(8), effective as of September, 8, 2006, states: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker of mortgage lender to falsify income or asset information on a mortgage loan application or mortgage loan documents.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) states: 	 Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1) states, in part: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to make any representation or statement of fact if the representation or statement is false or misleading or has the tendency or capacity to be misleading.  Books and records reviewed during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that Bay Mortgage when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker, had submitted to lenders Uniform Residential Loan Applications (""1003 Form"") in which the applicants' financial information including but not limited to applicants' gross income, disclosed liabilities, rental income, and/or employment information differed significantly and was not supported by the information reflected on other pertinent documentation which Bay Mortgage had in its possession.  The practices referenced in the Paragraph above were observed in the following fifteen loan transactions reviewed by the Division's examiners: Loan Nos. 48318, 39156823, 161049834, 123049651, 123094270, 1010045904, 10977098, 10978088, 1008322424, 5100004657, 5100004670, 261557, 1728264, 1728333, and 106042006535000. The examiners' specific findings are fully described in the Report and are incorporated herein by reference.  Bay Mortgage knew or should have known that the above referenced income and/or asset information would be relied upon in underwriting the mortgage loan by the mortgage lender or financial institution to which the mortgage loan applications were brokered by Bay Mortgage. 	 b. Alteration and/or Manipulation of Mortgage Loan Documents  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) states: 	 Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1) states, in part: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to make any representation or statement of fact if the representation or statement is false or misleading or has the tendency or capacity to be misleading.  The 2008 examination/inspection revealed that Bay Mortgage manipulated and/or altered various mortgage loan related documents. Examples of this practice include, but are not limited to, cutting and pasting borrower signatures to loan related documents and adding information to loan related documents subsequent to receiving the completed documents from a third party.  The practices referenced in the Paragraph above were observed in the following three loan transactions reviewed by the Division's examiners: Loan Nos. 1728264, 123040651 and 123094270. The examiners' specific findings are fully described in the Report and are incorporated herein by reference.  Bay Mortgage knew or should have known that the information reflected on the above referenced documents may have been relied upon in underwriting the mortgage loan by the mortgage lender or financial institution to which the mortgage loan applications were brokered by Bay Mortgage. 	 c. Signing of Blank or Incomplete Disclosures  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(6), effective as of September 8, 2006, states: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker or mortgage lender to have a consumer sign a blank or incomplete mortgage loan application or mortgage loan documents.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed instances in which applicants signed blank or incomplete initial disclosure forms, including but not limited to, Loan Origination and Compensation Agreements and an Attorney General's Mortgage Broker Disclosure. 	 C. Undisclosed Fees  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 183, section 63 states, in part: 	 A mortgagee, or a mortgage lender or mortgage broker as defined in section one of chapter two hundred and fifty-five E, shall not charge a loan fee, finder's fee, points, so-called, or similar fees in a mortgage transaction involving residential property located in the commonwealth of four or less units and occupied in whole or in part by the mortgagor, except to the extent that such fees or points have been previously disclosed to the mortgagor in writing, which disclosure may be in the form required by section seventeen D of chapter one hundred and eighty-four, or such other form which discloses said fees or points. A mortgagor shall not be obligated to pay fees or points which have not been previously disclosed as required herein.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection indicate that Bay Mortgage engaged in a pattern or practice of understatements or omissions of the fees charged to consumers by the Corporation.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection indicate that when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker, Bay Mortgage collected broker fees at the loan closing in amounts which the Corporation's books and records failed to document had been fully and accurately disclosed to consumers, in writing, in the amounts charged at closing, if at all, as more fully described in the Report. 	 D. Providing Mortgage Lender Disclosures to Consumers when Acting in the Capacity of a Mortgage Broker  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection indicate that Bay Mortgage, when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker, routinely provided several mortgage lender disclosures to consumers, including but not limited to, Equal Credit Opportunity Notices, Adjustable Rate Mortgage Disclosures, Escrow Waiver Forms and Notices to Applicant's of Right to Receive Copy of Appraisal Report. Such activity was in excess of the Corporation's authority as a mortgage broker.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 183, section 28C(a) states in part: 	 A lender shall not knowingly make a home loan if the home loan pays off all or part of an existing home loan that was consummated within the prior 60 months or other debt of the borrower, unless the refinancing is in the borrower's interest. The ""borrower's interest"" shall be narrowly construed, and the burden is upon the lender to determine that the refinancing is in the borrower's interest.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 53.07(1)(b) states in part: 	 A lender may request that a borrower acknowledge receipt of such a worksheet or other documentation; provided, however, a lender shall not shift the burden to the borrower to demonstrate that a home loan is in the borrowers' interest.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker, Bay Mortgage provided consumers a ""Determination of the Loan Exemption Status"" (""Statement""), a document that only mortgage lenders are authorized to provide to borrowers pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 183, section 28C(a).  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection also revealed that the language used in the Statement provided to the applicable consumers was not in compliance with 209 CMR 53.07(1)(b) inasmuch as it shifted the burden to the borrowers to demonstrate that the loan was in the their interest and to their benefit. 	 E. Misrepresentations to the Division  Pursuant to the Division's licensing requirements, mortgage brokers and lenders must submit the Uniform Mortgage Branch Office Form (""MU3 Form"") prior to opening a branch office. The MU3 Form requires that licensees identify the person who will be designated as the branch manager for that office. Licensees must also update information about a branch office, as necessary, by submitting amendments to the MU3 Form.  Each person designated as a branch manager in the MU3 Form must submit the Uniform Mortgage Biographical Statement and Consent Form (""MU2 Form""). The MU2 Form must also be submitted in the event of a change of branch manager. Such branch managers are subject to the Division's review and approval to ensure that the individuals possess the necessary business experience and financial responsibility to engage in the business of a mortgage broker or mortgage lender.  Based upon information submitted by Bay Mortgage and contained in the Division's records, Peter Lucido is identified as the branch manager of both the Plymouth and Quincy branches. However, during the 2008 examination/inspection, the Division's examiners determined that another individual was identified in the Corporation's books and records as the branch manager of the Plymouth location  .  Upon further inquiry, representatives of the Corporation stated that an individual other than Peter Lucido, who was identified as ""office manager"" on the phone list, supervised all operations in the Plymouth office.  As of the effective date of this Temporary Order, the Division has not received updated MU2 and MU3 forms indicating the name of the individual who is in fact acting as the branch manager at the Plymouth location.  By failing to notify the Division of the identity of the actual branch manager of the Plymouth office location and failing to submit the MU2 and MU3 Forms as required, Bay Mortgage prevented the Division from reviewing the qualifications and/or approving of the individual acting as the de facto manager. 	 F. Interest Rate Lock Commitments  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(3)(b) states, in part: 	 (b) ...A mortgage broker may only take a rate lock commitment fee for transmittal to the mortgage lender which intends to make the loan. Nothing herein shall prohibit a mortgage broker from negotiating the terms or conditions of a mortgage loan, including the interest rate, on behalf of a consumer. A mortgage broker may also use such forms or other evidence as desired to allow a consumer to indicate a preference to enter into a mortgage rate lock commitment with a mortgage lender. However, any such forms or evidence must clearly and conspicuously contain the following statement: ""This is a request, not a commitment, to lock your interest rate with a mortgage lender"".  The 2008 examination/inspection revealed that when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker, Bay Mortgage provided consumers with a ""Borrower-Broker Agreement"" (""Agreement"") which includes language that details the loan programs requested by the prospective borrowers with an option to either float or lock in a particular interest rate. The Agreement referenced in the preceding Paragraph did not contain the required language, ""This is a request, not a commitment, to lock your interest rate with a mortgage lender."" 	 G. Engaging in Prohibited Advertising Practices  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.15 states, in part: 	 A Licensee shall also disclose the type and number of its license(s) in all advertisements.  Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.04(2) states, in part: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to advertise without clearly and conspicuously disclosing its business name, the words ""broker"" or ""lender"", as applicable, and the license number.  Bay Mortgage failed to disclose the Corporation's license type and number on the Corporation's mortgage flyers and/or pamphlets. 	 H. Failure to Provide Notification of Regulatory Action  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.12(1)(c) states, in part: 	 A Licensee shall notify the Commissioner immediately, and in writing within one business day, of the occurrence of any of the following significant developments: . . . (c) [R]eceiving notification of the institution of . . . cease and desist, suspension or revocation procedures, or other formal or informal regulatory action, in any state against the Licensee, and the reasons thereof.  On December 31, 2008, the State of New Hampshire Banking Department (""New Hampshire Department"") issued an Order to Show Cause, Case No. 08-388, against Bay Mortgage (""New Hampshire Order""). The New Hampshire Order contains a Staff Petition in which the staff of the New Hampshire Department allege the following violations of New Hampshire law: failure to pay an examination fee and failure of the officer and owner of Bay Mortgage to respond to the New Hampshire Department inquires.  As of the effective date of this Temporary Order, the Division has not received notification from Bay Mortgage of the occurrence of the events referenced above in Paragraph 45 of this Temporary Order. 	 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 46, Bay Mortgage has failed to demonstrate and maintain the character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.03(2) and 42.06(2).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 46, by failing to maintain a net worth of not less than $100,000 or a combination of a net worth of not less than $25,000 and a bond of up to $75,000 that in the aggregate equal or exceed $100,000, Bay Mortgage violated the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.03(2).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 46, by falsifying borrowers' income information on Uniform Residential Loan Applications submitted in connection with residential mortgage transactions, Bay Mortgage has violated the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(8) and Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) and the Office of the Attorney General's implementing regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 46, by altering loan documentation related to the loan approval process, Bay Mortgage has violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) and the Office of the Attorney General's implementing regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 46, by having borrowers' sign blank or incomplete mortgage loan documents, Bay Mortgage has violated the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(6).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 46, by charging loan fees, points, or similar fees in a mortgage transaction involving residential property located in the Commonwealth, of four or less units and occupied in whole or in part by the mortgagor, in amounts exceeding those previously disclosed for such fees or points to the mortgagor in writing, Bay Mortgage has violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 183, section 63.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 46, by providing disclosures to consumers that only lenders are authorized to provide when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker, Bay Mortgage exceeded its authority as a mortgage broker in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 46, by providing borrowers with documentation that shifted the burden to the borrowers to demonstrate that the loans were in the borrowers' interest and to their benefit, Bay Mortgage violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 183, section 28C(a) and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 53.07(1).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 46, when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker by providing the ""Borrower-Broker Agreement"" form, which presents the inference that the Corporation can lock an interest rate on behalf of the consumer and by failing to include required disclosure language in the aforementioned Agreement, Bay Mortgage has violated the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(3).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 46, by failing to disclose and/or inaccurately disclosing the Corporation's license type and number on the Corporations mortgage flyers and/or pamphlets, Bay Mortgage has violated the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.15 and the Attorney General's regulation at 940 CMR 8.04(2).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 46, Bay Mortgage failed to notify the Commissioner in writing, within one business day, that on December 31, 2008 the New Hampshire Banking Department issued an Order to Show Cause in violation of the Division's Regulation 209 CMR 42.12(1)(c)  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 46, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 Bay Mortgage has engaged in, is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that it is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00 et seq.; and  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to Bay Mortgage.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 46, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of Bay Mortgage's original mortgage broker and mortgage lender license applications, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.04 and 209 CMR 42.07. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 46, present sufficient grounds for the revocation of Bay Mortgage's broker license pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(19). 	 ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that Bay Mortgage and any and all officers, directors, employees, independent contractors, or agents operating on behalf of Bay Mortgage, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of (a) a mortgage broker and mortgage lender, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, (b) a mortgage loan originator, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Temporary Order.

In the event that no such placement can be made, Bay Mortgage shall either independently fund the mortgage loan under such terms and conditions or buy down the mortgage loan offered by the lender so that the applicant does not incur a loss as a result of such placement.

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Bay Mortgage shall immediately secure all pending mortgage loan application files and, to the extent that any original documents must be forwarded to the relevant mortgage lender or mortgage broker pursuant to Paragraph 62 of this Temporary Order, a copy of such document, correspondence, or paper relating to the mortgage loan shall be retained in Bay Mortgage's books and records and shall be available to the Commissioner, in their entirety, immediately upon request on the date and time specified by the Commissioner.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that within sixty (60) days of the effective date of this Temporary Order, the Corporation shall cause to be made a review of all Massachusetts residential mortgage loans originated by Bay Mortgage since August 12, 2004 and shall identify all mortgage loan transactions in which the amount actually paid by the consumer as a loan fee, mortgage broker fee, application fee, or similar fee, as recorded on the settlement agreement, exceeded the amount disclosed to the consumer, in writing, for such fees prior to closing; 	 In each mortgage loan transaction identified pursuant to Paragraph 65  ,  Bay Mortgage shall reimburse the consumer the difference between the actual charge assessed to the individual consumer as a loan fee, mortgage broker fee, processing fee, or similar fee and the amount disclosed in writing for such fees prior to closing;  Within sixty (60) days of the effective date of this Temporary Order, Bay Mortgage shall submit to the Commissioner a list of all borrowers identified pursuant to the above described review of residential mortgage loan transactions to whom a reimbursement is owed by the Corporation in accordance with this Paragraph of the Temporary Order; and  Within ninety (90) days of the effective date of this Temporary Order, Bay Mortgage shall submit evidence of all reimbursements issued to consumers pursuant to this Paragraph of the Temporary Order, including the consumers' names, the dates the loans closed, check numbers, and the amount of the reimbursements.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE LENDER AND  MORTGAGE BROKER  LICENSING  Docket No. 2009-003  FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  MORTGAGE ASSOCIATES, INC.  North Dartmouth, Massachusetts  Mortgage Company License No(s). MC0112  MC2336, MC4785 and MC5244  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that MORTGAGE ASSOCIATES, INC., (""Mortgage Associates"" or the ""Corporation""), located at 125 Faunce Corner Road, Unit C, North Dartmouth, Massachusetts has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""Temporary Order"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  Mortgage Associates is, and at all relevant times has been, a Massachusetts Corporation doing business in the Commonwealth. Mortgage Associates' main office is located at 125 Faunce Corner Road, Unit C, North Dartmouth, Massachusetts.  Mortgage Associates is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage lender and mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage lender and mortgage broker license, license numbers, ML0112 and MB0127 respectively, to Mortgage Associates to engage in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker on or about January 1, 1992. On or about May 31, 2003, the Commissioner issued a consolidated mortgage lender and mortgage broker license to the Corporation, with license number MC0112. License number MC0112 authorized Mortgage Associates to conduct the mortgage business from the Corporation's main office located at 125 Faunce Corner Road, Unit C, North Dartmouth, Massachusetts.  Mortgage Associates maintains three additional mortgage lender and mortgage broker licenses, license numbers MC2336, MC4785 and MC5244 for licensed office locations at 31 Belmont Street, Easton, Massachusetts, 18 S. Main Street, Ext, Plymouth, Massachusetts and 875 Centerville Road, Warwick, Rhode Island respectively, from which the Corporation conducts its mortgage business.  Mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers in Massachusetts are licensed and regulated under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, which is administered and enforced by the Commissioner. Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division is authorized to inspect the books, accounts, papers, records, and files of mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers transacting business in Massachusetts to determine compliance with the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E or any rule, or regulation issued thereunder, and with any law, rule, or regulation applicable to the conduct of the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker.  On Monday, September 29, 2008, pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division commenced an examination/inspection of the books, accounts, papers, records, and files maintained by Mortgage Associates to evaluate the Corporation's compliance with the laws, regulations, and regulatory bulletins applicable to the conduct of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker business in Massachusetts (the ""2008 examination/inspection"").  The Division's Report of Examination/Inspection on Consumer Compliance (the ""Report""), which was issued to Mortgage Associates on the effective date of this Temporary Order, presented the findings of the 2008 examination/inspection and alleged significant failures to comply with applicable state and federal laws, rules, regulations, and regulatory bulletins governing the conduct of those engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts. 	 A. Unfair or Deceptive Acts and Practices  a. Misleading Representations of a Prospective Borrower's Income  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(8), effective as of September, 8, 2006, states: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker of mortgage lender to falsify income or asset information on a mortgage loan application or mortgage loan documents.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) states: 	 Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1) states, in part: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to make any representation or statement of fact if the representation or statement is false or misleading or has the tendency or capacity to be misleading.  Books and records reviewed during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that Mortgage Associates, when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker, had completed and submitted to lenders Uniform Residential Loan Applications (""1003 Form"") in which the applicants' financial information, including but not limited to, applicants' base employment income, differed significantly from the financial information reflected on other pertinent documentation, including, but not limited to bank statements and W-2 statements which Mortgage Associates had in its possession. Examples include but are not limited to the following: 	 Loan # 0005553714: 		 A stated income purchase money loan application prepared by Mortgage Associates for a loan which ultimately closed on May 8, 2007, indicated that the borrower, a retiree, earned approximately $4,352 monthly, with additional rental income in the amount of $2,250, for a total of $6,602 monthly or $79,224 annually.  A review of redacted bank statements located in the loan file however revealed single monthly social security of $910 or $10,920.  Land records reviewed by the Division's examiners revealed that the property secured by the loan had subsequently been foreclosed in January 2008.  Loan #107031612374000 		 A stated income, second mortgage loan application prepared by Mortgage Associates for a loan which ultimately closed on March 30, 2007, indicated that the borrower, a Lead Transportation Security Officer for the Department of Homeland Security earned approximately $15,250, with additional monthly rental income of $622 for a total of $15,872 monthly or $190,464 annually.  A copy of a 2006 W-2 statement located in the loan file maintained by Mortgage Associates revealed that the borrower's gross earnings were $3,577.98 monthly or $42,935.87 annually.  A year-end 1099 statement located in the loan file revealed an additional source of income indicating that the borrower was also employed at a mortgage company as a loan originator. However, this source of income was not reflected on the loan application forwarded to the lender. Gross earnings reflected on the 1099 statement were $73,018.66.  The discrepancy between the information reflected on the loan application, relative to the combined annual income derived from the W-2 statement and the 1099 statement located in the loan file maintained by Mortgage Associates, revealed that the Corporation overstated the borrower's annual income by approximately $74,509.  Land records reviewed by the Division's examiners revealed that the property secured by the loan had subsequently been foreclosed in May 2008.  Loan No(s). 1890295383& 1000111506300917102 		 A copy of a purchase money stated loan application for a first lien prepared by Mortgage Associates for a loan which ultimately closed on May 31, 2006 indicated that the borrower, a manager at a waste disposal company, earned approximately $12,000 monthly or $144,000 annually.  A copy of a purchase money stated loan application for a simultaneous second lien prepared by Mortgage Associates for a loan which ultimately closed on May 31, 2006 indicated that the borrower, a manager at a waste disposal company, earned approximately $14,300 monthly or $176,600 annually. The application noted additional rental income of $1,200 monthly or $14,400 annually.  Copies of three pay stubs issued during April 2006 and retained in the loan file maintained by Mortgage Associates reflected that the borrower earned $12.50 per hour, which after four months when aggregated yielded gross year-to-date earnings of $9,821.90, which extrapolated through the end of the year would be $29,465.70 annually.  A copy of year-end W-2 statement for 2005 maintained by Mortgage Associates reflected the borrower's gross income as 27,749.64.  The discrepancy between the information reflected on the purchase money stated loan application for a first lien, the 2006 paystubs and the W-2 statement located in the loan file maintained by Mortgage Associates revealed that the Corporation overstated the borrower's annual income by approximately $116,251.  The discrepancy between the information reflected on purchase money stated loan application for a simultaneous second lien the 2006 paystubs and the W-2 statement located in the loan file maintained by Mortgage Associates revealed that the Corporation overstated the borrower's annual income by approximately $148,850.  The practices referenced in the Paragraph above were also observed in the following loan transactions reviewed by the Division's examiners: Loan Nos.: 0059590257, 1890183506, 1008865873, 381026167, 6854213342, 106051214578000, 122741200, 4660540, 0055912257, 0055912554, 826858860, 0056130636, 105087402397000, 5100001432, and 105087402397000. The examiners' specific findings are fully described in the Report and are incorporated herein by reference.  Mortgage Associates knew or should have known that the above referenced income and/or asset information would be relied upon in underwriting the mortgage loan by the mortgage lender or financial institution to which the mortgage loan applications were brokered by Mortgage Associates.  Land records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that at least two properties were foreclosed subsequent to settlement. 	 b. Alteration and/or Manipulation of Mortgage Loan Documents  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) states: 	 Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1) states, in part: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to make any representation or statement of fact if the representation or statement is false or misleading or has the tendency or capacity to be misleading.  The 2008 examination/inspection revealed that Mortgage Associates manipulated and/or altered various mortgage loan related documents. Examples of this practice include, but are not limited to,: cutting and pasting samples of borrower signatures onto additional loan related documents; altering execution dates on various loan related documents; and adding and/or deleting information on loan related documents subsequent to receiving the completed documents from a third party.  The practices referenced in the Paragraph above were observed in the following eight (8) loan transactions reviewed by the Division's examiners: Loan Nos.: 6189667808, 6204704685, 6727173863, 1008865873, 0004354814, 0062812532, 106111715778000 and 6277873706. The examiners' specific findings are fully described in the Report and are incorporated herein by reference.  Mortgage Associates knew or should have known that the information reflected on the above referenced documents would have been relied upon in underwriting the mortgage loan by the mortgage lender or financial institution to which the mortgage loan applications were brokered by Mortgage Associates.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(7), effective as of September 8, 2006, states: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker or mortgage lender to sign a consumer's name to a mortgage loan application or mortgage loan documents on behalf of a consumer.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed substantial inconsistencies in the appearance of the borrowers' signatures between documents signed by the borrower at the loan closing and applications and broker disclosures retained in Mortgage Associates' books and records. The inconsistencies suggest that the applications and broker disclosures were signed by a party other than the borrower.  The above practices were observed in the following eight (8) loan transactions: Loan No(s).: 1890361502, 6727173863, 6204704685, 10098699706, 105063010033000, 105110802427000, 106080211029000 and 1009659719. The examiners' specific findings are fully described in the Report and are incorporated herein by reference.  Mortgage Associates knew or should have known that the mortgage lender and/or financial institution to which Mortgage Associates brokered the aforementioned loans would have made the borrower's receipt of either the initial or subsequent broker disclosures a condition of the loan closing and would have relied on the borrower's signature on either document as evidence of receipt. 	 c. Misrepresentation of the Applicant's Residency Status  The 2008 examination/inspection revealed that Mortgage Associates concealed and/or misrepresented information relating to the occupancy of the subject premises. Mortgage Associates had submitted to separate lenders, purchase money mortgage loan applications for two properties on behalf of a single borrower simultaneously, with each application indicating that the subject property was to be used as the borrower's primary residence.  The above practices were observed in the following loan transactions: (a) Loan No(s). 40783230 and 40783232; and (b) Loan No(s). 0159437938 and 2070316123740000. The examiners' specific findings are more fully described in the Report and are incorporated herein by reference. 	 B. Undisclosed Fees  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 183, section 63 states, in part: 	 A mortgagee, or a mortgage lender or mortgage broker as defined in section one of chapter two hundred and fifty-five E, shall not charge a loan fee, finder's fee, points, so-called, or similar fees in a mortgage transaction involving residential property located in the commonwealth of four or less units and occupied in whole or in part by the mortgagor, except to the extent that such fees or points have been previously disclosed to the mortgagor in writing, which disclosure may be in the form required by section seventeen D of chapter one hundred and eighty-four, or such other form which discloses said fees or points. A mortgagor shall not be obligated to pay fees or points which have not been previously disclosed as required herein.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection indicate, as more fully described in the Report, that Mortgage Associates engaged in a pattern or practice of understatements or omissions of the fees charged to consumers by Mortgage Associates.  The Corporations books and records indicate that processing fees, origination fees, loan fees, or similar fees (collectively, ""broker fees"") were collected at the loan closing in amounts which Mortgage Associates books and records failed to illustrate had been fully and accurately disclosed to consumers, in writing, to the extent charged at closing, if at all as more fully described in the Report. 	 C. Failure to Maintain Net Worth Requirements  Pursuant to the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.03(2)(a), as applicable to Mortgage Associates (Pursuant to the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.17, mortgage lenders and brokers are required to demonstrate compliance with amendments to 209 CMR 42.03 by December 31, 2008. The cited language included in this Paragraph of the Temporary Order is reproduced from the Division's regulation as it existed prior to the regulatory amendments, thus representing the requirements applicable to Mortgage Associates at the time of the 2008 examination/inspection.): 	 (2)(a)... An Applicant shall demonstrate and maintain:  1. a net worth of not less than $100,000; or  2. a combination of a net worth of not less than $ 25,000 and a bond of up to $ 75,000 in such form and with such sureties as may be approved by the Commissioner, provided such net worth and bond in the aggregate equal or exceed $ 100,000.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that, after adjusting Mortgage Associates' capital position in accordance with the definition of ""net worth"" under 209 CMR 42.02, Mortgage Associates reported a net worth position which was less than the $100,000 minimum requirement.  At the time of the 2008 Examination/Inspection, Mortgage Associates did not maintain a surety bond to supplement its net worth position. 	 D. Providing Mortgage Lender Disclosures to Consumers When Acting in the Capacity of a Mortgage Broker  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 183, section 28C(a) states in part: 	 A lender shall not knowingly make a home loan if the home loan pays off all or part of an existing home loan that was consummated within the prior 60 months or other debt of the borrower, unless the refinancing is in the borrower's interest. The ""borrower's interest"" shall be narrowly construed, and the burden is upon the lender to determine that the refinancing is in the borrower's interest.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 53.07(1)(b) states in part: 	 A lender may request that a borrower acknowledge receipt of such a worksheet or other documentation; provided, however, a lender shall not shift the burden to the borrower to demonstrate that a home loan is in the borrowers' interest.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker, Mortgage Associates provided consumers with a ""Net Tangible Benefit Disclosure and Acknowledgement"" (""Form"") on the Corporation's letterhead. It has been the Division's longstanding position that the determination of the borrower's interest is the lender's responsibility and the burden should not be shifted to the borrower or made by a mortgage broker. By distributing the Form to prospective borrowers on the Corporation's letterhead when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker, Mortgage Associates exceeded its authority as a mortgage broker and distributed a form which appeared to shift the burden to the borrower.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection indicate that Mortgage Associates, when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker, routinely provided several other mortgage lender disclosures to consumers in addition to the referenced Form.  The mortgage lender disclosures include, but are not limited to, Equal Credit Opportunity Notices, Servicing Disclosure Statements, Truth in Lending Statements and Pre-Approval Letters. 	 E. Loan Origination and Compensation Agreement  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(5) states in part: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker to fail to provide to the consumer at the time of application the loan origination and compensation agreement required under 209 CMR 42.16. The content of the agreement shall strictly conform to 209 CMR 42.16 and include signatures and dates by the consumer(s) and the mortgage broker.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.09(1)(b) states, in part: 	 Each mortgage broker . . . shall retain for a minimum of three years after a mortgage loan is made the following: the original loan origination and compensation agreement as set out in 209 CMR 42.16.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that Mortgage Associates when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker, failed to retain evidence of having provided the Loan Origination and Compensation Agreements in several loan files reviewed. 	 F. Failure to Properly Maintain Books and Records  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8 states in part: 	 A licensee shall keep and use such business records in such form and at such location as said commissioner shall, by regulation, determine, which shall enable said commissioner to determine whether such licensee is complying with the provisions of this chapter and any rules or regulations promulgated hereunder by said commissioner and any other law, rule or regulation applicable to the conduct of the business for which it is licensed under this chapter.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(12) states: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker or mortgage lender to engage in a pattern or practice of failing to make any disclosure to a consumer required by and at the time specified by any applicable state or federal law, regulation or directive.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.09(1) states: 	 Each Licensee shall keep and use its books, records and accounts in a manner which will allow the Commissioner to determine whether the Licensee is complying with the provisions of M.G.L. c. 255E and applicable state and federal laws and regulations. Each Licensee shall comply with the provisions of 209 CMR 48.00...  (b) The mortgage broker ... shall retain for a minimum of three years after a mortgage loan is made the following: the original loan origination and compensation agreement as set out in 209 CMR 42.16; a copy of the settlement statement; an account of fees received in connection with the loan; correspondence; papers or records relating to the loan; and such other documents as the Commissioner may require.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection indicated that Mortgage Associates, when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker, failed to retain sufficient documentation to enable the Division's examiners to determine whether the Corporation was complying with certain laws and regulations governing mortgage brokers in Massachusetts, including but not limited to, compliance with timing requirements in which certain disclosures must be provided to consumers. 	 G. Misleading Statements  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1) states, in part: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to make any representation or statement of fact if the representation or statement is false or misleading, or has the tendency or capacity to be misleading.  Books and records reviewed during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that Mortgage Associates, when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker, provided applicants with a Borrower's Certification and Authorization Form that contained language that was false or misleading or had the tendency or capacity to be false or misleading. Specifically, the Borrower's Certification and Authorization Form contained language which would present the appearance that Mortgage Associates was approving or funding the mortgage loan. 	 H. Failure to Properly Complete Good Faith Estimates  The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (""RESPA"") regulation 24 CMR 3500.7, Appendix B section 13 states, in part: 	 Any . . .fee or payment received by the mortgage broker from either the lender or the borrower arising from the initial funding transaction, including a servicing release premium or yield spread premium, is to be noted on the Good Faith Estimate and listed in the 800 series of the HUD-1 Settlement Statement.  Books and records reviewed during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that, in all loan files reviewed, Mortgage Associates failed to disclose the yield spread premium paid at closing on the good faith estimate provided to the borrower(s), as specifically identified in the Report. 	 I. Failure to Provide the Division Required Notice of Significant Events  a. Failure to Provide Notice of Change in Net Worth  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12(1)(k) states in part: 	 A Licensee shall notify the Commissioner immediately, and in writing within one business day, of the occurrence of ... (k) Any change to net worth resulting from market valuation or future loss liability or any other change which causes the net worth of the licensee to fall below the requirements of 209 CMR 42.03, 209 CMR 42.06, 209 CMR 42.08A, and 209 CMR 42.11A(1)(a).  The 2008 examination/inspection revealed that Mortgage Associates failed to notify the Division of the Corporation's change in net worth. Specifically, Mortgage Associates submitted a quarterly report to the Division which indicated that the Corporation's insufficient capital position and was thereafter notified by the Division that Mortgage Associates net worth was below the regulatory requirements. 	 b. Failure to Provide Notice of Change in Ownership  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12(3)(a) states: 	 15 days prior to any proposed change in control in the ownership of a Licensee, or among the officers, partners or directors of a Licensee, a notice shall forthwith be filed with the Commissioner who may thereupon cause such investigation to be made as he deems necessary, as if it were a new license. In the case of a corporation, control is defined as a change of ownership by a person or group acting in concert to acquire ten percent of the stock, or the ability of a person or group acting in concert to elect a majority of the directors or otherwise effect a change in policy of the corporation.  Books and records reviewed during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that Mortgage Associates failed to provide fifteen days prior notice of a change in control in the ownership of the Corporation.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE LENDER AND  MORTGAGE BROKER  LICENSING  Docket No. 2009-008  FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  U.S. Mortgage Corp.  Pine Brook, New Jersey  Mortgage Lender and Mortgage Broker  License No(s). MC4989, MC4991 & MC5294  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that U.S. MORTGAGE CORP., (""U.S. Mortgage"" or the ""Corporation"") located at 19D Chapin Road, Pine Brook, New Jersey, has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""Temporary Order"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  U.S. Mortgage is, and at all relevant times, has been a foreign Corporation conducting business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. U.S. Mortgage's main office is located at 19D Chapin Road, Pine Brook, New Jersey.  U.S. Mortgage is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage lender and mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage company license, license number MC4989 to U.S. Mortgage to engage in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker on or about June 8, 2007. License number MC4989 authorized U.S. Mortgage to conduct the mortgage company business from the Corporation's main office located at 19D Chapin Road, Pine Brook, New Jersey.  U.S. Mortgage maintains a licensed office location at 92 Francis Street, Marlborough, Massachusetts from which the Corporation conducts its mortgage lender and mortgage broker business. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner issued a mortgage company license, license number MC4991 to U.S. Mortgage for the Marlborough location on or about June 8, 2007.  U.S. Mortgage maintains a licensed office location at 20 Trafalgar Square, Nashua, New Hampshire from which the Corporation conducts its mortgage lender and mortgage broker business. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner issued a mortgage company license, license number MC5294 to U.S. Mortgage for the New Hampshire location on November 12, 2008.  On February 6, 2009, the Division received correspondence from Andrew L. Liput, Senior Vice President and General Counsel of U. S. Mortgage, dated February 2, 2009, informing the Division that U. S. Mortgage is under a federal investigation for misappropriation of funds. 	 A. Failure to Provide Access to Books and Records  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.09(4) states: 	 In addition to the reports required by law, a Licensee shall make such other statements and reports to the Commissioner as he or she may require from time to time. The Commissioner may require regular quarterly reports and may furnish blank forms for all such statements or reports, required by 209 CMR 42.09.  On Tuesday, February 10, 2009, the Division submitted a letter to U.S. Mortgage via email and facsimile requiring that, among other things, the Corporation submit a detailed record, prepared as of the close of business on February 6, 2009, of all pending residential mortgage loan applications on properties located in each of the states in which U.S. Mortgage operated, including Massachusetts (the ""pipeline report""), a list of the Corporation's warehouse lines of credit or funding sources, with current balances and available funds for each line, a list of loans that the Corporation was required to repurchase during the past twelve months, and a report of loans held for sale and held for investment.  The Division requested that the pipeline report and the warehouse/funding source information be provided by no later than 5:00 PM (EST) on Wednesday, February 11, 2009.  As of the date of this Temporary Order, the information requested in Paragraph 8 of this Temporary Order has not been provided to the Division in its entirety. 	 B. Failure to Provide Notice of Significant Events  a. Impairment of Warehouse Lines of Credit  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.12(1)(e) states, in part: 	  (1) A Licensee shall notify the Commissioner immediately, and in writing within one business day, of the occurrence of any of the following significant developments: . . . (e) Expiration, termination or default, technical or otherwise, of any existing line of credit or warehouse credit agreement.  On Wednesday, February 11, 2009, through communications with a member of the mortgage industry, the Division became aware that U.S. Mortgage had ceased all retail operations on or around February 9, 2009. During the course of said communications, a copy of a statement (""Statement"") issued by U.S. Mortgage to the Corporation's mortgage broker network, was forwarded to the Division. In the Statement, , U.S. Mortgage indicated that the Corporation's warehouse lines of credit were at capacity and they would be unable to ""secure any additional funding.""  The Statement further stated in part: 	 ""For files that have been given a commitment, U.S. Mortgage will be unable to meet the commitment. For loans that have closed but not funded, U.S. Mortgage will not be able to fund those loans as well.""  A line of credit used by a mortgage lender enables the entity to fund mortgage loans prior to selling them to an investor. Without access to its lines of credit, and in the absence of the mortgage lender independently maintaining sufficient reserves and liquidity positions on its books to fund such loans, the mortgage lender would be unable to meet its funding commitments, negating its ability to meet contractual obligations to fund mortgage loans.  As of the issuance of this Temporary Order, U.S. Mortgage has not notified the Division of the facts and circumstances set forth above. 	 b. Failure to Provide Notice of Termination of Relationship with the Federal National Mortgage Association  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.12(1)(f) states in part: 	  (1) A Licensee shall notify the Commissioner immediately, and in writing within one business day, of the occurrence of any of the following significant developments: . . . (f) Suspension or termination of the Licensee's status as an approved seller or seller/servicer by the Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, Government National Mortgage Association or an investor approved under  209 CMR 42.11A(1)(a) .  On Thursday, February 12, 2009, the Division became aware through a statement issued by a representative of CU National a subsidiary of U.S. Mortgage to the  Credit Union Times  that the Corporation had also lost access to Federal National Mortgage Association (""FANNIE MAE"") as ""a delivery channel on the secondary market.""  As of the issuance of this Temporary Order, U.S. Mortgage has not notified the Division of the termination of the Corporation's relationship with FANNIE MAE. 	 c. Failure to Provide Notice of Closing of Licensed Branch Locations  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.13(2) states: 	  Licensees shall provide thirty days prior written notice of any change or closing of a Massachusetts location to the Commissioner and shall contain such other information as the Commissioner may require.  The Statement issued by U.S. Mortgage stated in part ""U.S. Mortgage has ceased all retail operations immediately, effective immediately.""  As of the issuance of this Temporary Order, U.S. Mortgage has not notified the Division of the facts and circumstances set forth above. 	 C. Failure to Fund Loans  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.12A(16) states: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage lender to contract with a consumer through the underwriting and subsequent execution of mortgage loan closing documents and thereafter fail to fund the mortgage loan.  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.06(8) states: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a lender to fail to disburse funds in accordance with any commitment or agreement with the borrower.  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.12A(17) states: 	 A violation of 209 CMR 42.12A shall constitute grounds for the issuance of a cease and desist order under M.G.L. c. 255E, § 7; shall constitute grounds for license suspension or revocation under M.G.L. c. 255E, § 6 and shall constitute grounds for an administrative fine or penalty under M.G.L. c. 255E, §§ 11 and 12.  On February 11, 2009, the Division, through communications with another state banking department, became aware that at least thirty (30) Massachusetts consumers had been affected by the Statement issued by U.S. Mortgage and referenced in Paragraph 11 of this Temporary Order. Information received from the state banking department revealed that at least one Massachusetts loan was in the pre-closing stage, eighteen (18) Massachusetts loans were in the approved stage and eleven (11) Massachusetts loans were at the underwriting stage of the loan process. Based upon information and belief, U.S. Mortgage has no intention to fund or otherwise obtain alternate funding for the loans referenced in this Paragraph under the same terms and conditions as set forth in the agreements with the borrowers.  On February 13, 2009, representatives of U.S. Mortgage participated in a teleconference (the ""Teleconference"") with representatives of the Division and representatives of other states. During the teleconference, representatives of U.S. Mortgage confirmed that approximately 20 mortgage loans nationwide had closed but not been funded. U.S. Mortgage could not provide the specific information regarding the unfunded loans. 	 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 26, by failing to provide the Division access to the Corporation's books and records, U.S. Mortgage is in violation of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.09(4).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 26, U.S. Mortgage failed to notify the Commissioner within one business day of the expiration, termination, or default, technical or otherwise, of at least one existing line of credit or warehouse credit agreement, in violation of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12(1)(e).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 26, U.S. Mortgage failed to notify the Commissioner within one business day of the termination of the Corporation's relationship with Federal National Mortgage Association in violation of 209 CMR 42.12(1)(f).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 26, by contracting to originate mortgage loan(s) that U.S. Mortgage did not have sufficient warehouse funds available to fund, or any other available alternative source of funds, U.S. Mortgage has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices in violation of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.04(2)(b)(3).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 26, by contracting with consumers for the refinance of mortgage loan(s) through the underwriting and subsequent execution of mortgage loan closing documents relating to residential property, and thereafter failing to fund the mortgage loan(s), U.S. Mortgage has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices in violation of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.04(2)(b)(3).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 26, U.S. Mortgage failed to provide the Commissioner with thirty days prior written notice of the Corporation's intention to cease business operations in violation of 209 CMR 42.13(2).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 26, U.S. Mortgage has failed to demonstrate the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.03(2)(c) and 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 26, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 U.S. Mortgage has engaged in, is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that it is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. ; and  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to U.S. Mortgage.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 26, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of U.S. Mortgage original mortgage lender and mortgage broker license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 25 present sufficient grounds for the revocation U.S. Mortgage's mortgage lender and mortgage broker license pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.04(2)(b) and 209 CMR 42.07(2)(b).

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE BROKER  LICENSING  Docket No. 2009-005  FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  MIRACLE MORTGAGE CORP.  Canton, Massachusetts  Mortgage Broker License No. MB1670  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that MIRACLE MORTGAGE CORP. (""Miracle Mortgage"" or the ""Corporation""), located at 354 Turnpike Street, Canton, Massachusetts, has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""Temporary Order"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  Miracle Mortgage is, and at all relevant times has been, a Massachusetts Corporation doing business in the Commonwealth. Miracle Mortgage's main office of record is located at 354 Turnpike Street, Canton, Massachusetts.  Miracle Mortgage is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage broker license, license number MB1670, to Miracle Mortgage to engage in the business of a mortgage broker in Massachusetts on or about June 14, 1999. License number MB1670 authorized Miracle Mortgage to conduct its mortgage broker business from the Corporation's main office located at 354 Turnpike Street, Canton, Massachusetts.  Mortgage brokers in Massachusetts are licensed and regulated under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, which is administered and enforced by the Commissioner. Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division is authorized to inspect the books, accounts, papers, records, and files of mortgage brokers transacting business in Massachusetts to determine compliance with the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E or any rule, or regulation issued thereunder, and with any law, rule, or regulation applicable to the conduct of the business of a mortgage broker.  Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division conducted an onsite examination/inspection of the books, accounts, papers, records, and files maintained by Miracle Mortgage to evaluate the Corporation's compliance with the laws, regulations, and regulatory bulletins applicable to the conduct of a mortgage broker business in Massachusetts (the ""2008 examination/inspection""). The onsite portion of the 2008 examination/inspection was completed on or about September 4, 2008.  The Division's Report of Examination/Inspection on Consumer Compliance (the ""Report""), which was issued to Miracle Mortgage on the effective date of this Temporary Order, presented the findings of the 2008 examination/inspection and alleged significant failures to comply with applicable state and federal laws, rules, regulations, and regulatory bulletins governing the conduct of those engaged in the business of a mortgage broker in Massachusetts. 	 A. Misleading Representations of a Prospective Borrower's Income  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) states: 	 Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1) states, in part: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to make any representation or statement of fact if the representation or statement is false or misleading or has the tendency or capacity to be misleading.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(8), effective as of September, 8, 2006, states: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker or mortgage lender to falsify income or asset information on a mortgage loan application or mortgage loan documents.  The 2008 examination/inspection revealed that Miracle Mortgage, had submitted to lenders Uniform Residential Loan Applications (""1003 Form"") in which the applicants' financial information including applicants' gross income differed significantly from the financial information reflected on other pertinent documents including bank statements, and verification of employment forms and reduced documentation loan disclosures found in the file which the Corporation had in its possession. Examples include, but are not limited to the following: 	 Loan No.:05-825990: 		 A copy of a stated loan application prepared by Miracle Mortgage for a loan which ultimately closed on August 3, 2005 indicated that the borrower, a senior custodian at the Boston Public Library, earned approximately $5,500 monthly, or $66,000 annually.  Publicly available Commonwealth payroll records indicate that the borrower earned $43,184 in 2007.  The discrepancy reveals that Miracle Mortgage overstated the borrower's annual income by approximately $22,816.  In response to the Division's inquiry regarding the apparent discrepancy, an officer of Miracle Mortgage stated that upon advisement of a lender's account executive, the borrower's income was reported as an amount equal to the combined household income of the borrower and his spouse.  However, the loan application forwarded to the lender did not include the spouse as a co-borrower and only the husband's credit profile was presented for loan qualification.  Loan No.: 4000010923: 		 A copy of a stated loan application prepared by Miracle Mortgage for a loan which ultimately closed on July 31, 2006 indicated that the borrower, a Dental Assistant, earned approximately $5,700 monthly or $68,400 annually.  Copies of the borrower's checking account statements located in the loan file maintained by Miracle Mortgage indicated that two deposits, each in the amount of $970.61 were made on a monthly basis from the borrower's current employer.  In response to the Division's inquiry regarding the apparent discrepancy, an officer of Miracle Mortgage stated that the borrower was a close friend of the officer's family and that the borrower was the owner of a cleaning company and an accountant, both occupations, which provided an additional source of income. The loan application forwarded to the lender, however, failed to reference these occupations or to identify that the base income included additional funds generated from alternate occupations.  The discrepancy between the information reflected on the loan application and the bank statements maintained in the loan file reveals that Miracle Mortgage overstated or misreported the borrower's annual income as a dental assistant by approximately $45,105.36.  Loan No.: 04-G00996: 		 A copy of a loan application prepared by Miracle Mortgage for a loan which ultimately closed on November 2, 2004 indicated that the borrower, an employee in the crating and packing department of a shipping company, earned approximately $3,500 monthly, or $42,000 annually.  A copy of a Verification of Employment Form (""VOE"") maintained in the loan file revealed that the borrower's annual salary for the previous three years was $27,280, $32,300 and $28,200 respectively. A review of a second VOE located in the loan file reviewed by the Division's examiners revealed that the annual income was concealed with white-out fluid.  In response to the Division's inquiry regarding the apparent discrepancy, an officer of Miracle Mortgage stated the borrower's wife was removed from the application subsequent to determining that her credit score would affect the interest rate and being advised to do so by a lender's account executive.  The discrepancy between the information reflected on the loan application and the highest salary reflected on the VOE located in the loan file maintained by Miracle Mortgage reveals that the Corporation overstated the borrower's annual income by approximately $9,700.  Loan No.: 0000495298: 		 A copy of a stated loan application prepared by Miracle Mortgage for a loan which ultimately closed on July 24, 2006 indicated that the borrower, earned approximately $42,000 annually as a bus driver and $22,000 annually as a part time security guard for a total of $64,000 annually.  A copy of a VOE submitted by the borrower's part time employer revealed that the income information was manipulated by using ""white out"" to obscure the borrower's hourly rate, upon closer inspection, was determined to be $13.00 or approximately $13,520 annually.  The discrepancy between the information reflected on the loan application and the VOE located in the loan file maintained by Miracle Mortgage reveals that the Corporation overstated the borrower's annual income as a part time security guard by approximately $8,480.  In response to the Division's inquiry regarding the apparent discrepancy, an officer of Miracle Mortgage stated that the borrower was her nephew and actually worked three jobs, and the third undisclosed job was a ""side job."" The officer further indicated that a lender's account executive had advised her to take a stated income loan application.  Miracle Mortgage knew or should have known that the above referenced income, asset information, and/or employment information would be relied upon in underwriting the mortgage loan by the mortgage lender or financial institution to which the mortgage loan applications were brokered by Miracle Mortgage. 	 B. Failure to Properly Maintain Books and Records  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8 states in part: 	 A licensee shall keep and use such business records in such form and at such location as said commissioner shall, by regulation, determine, which shall enable said commissioner to determine whether such licensee is complying with the provisions of this chapter and any rules or regulations promulgated hereunder by said commissioner and nay other law, rule or regulation applicable to the conduct of the business for which it is licensed under this chapter.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(12) states 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker or mortgage lender to engage in a pattern or practice of failing to make any disclosure to a consumer required by and at the time specified by any applicable state or federal law, regulation or directive.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.09(1) states: 	 Each Licensee shall keep and use its books, records and accounts in a manner which will allow the Commissioner to determine whether the Licensee is complying with the provisions of M.G.L. c. 255E and applicable state and federal laws and regulations. Each Licensee shall comply with the provisions of 209 CMR 48.00...  (b) The mortgage broker ... shall retain for a minimum of three years after a mortgage loan is made the following: the original loan origination and compensation agreement as set out in 209 CMR 42.16; a copy of the settlement statement; an account of fees received in connection with the loan; correspondence; papers or records relating to the loan; and such other documents as the Commissioner may require.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection indicated that Miracle Mortgage failed to retain sufficient documentation to enable the Division's examiners to determine whether the Corporation was complying with certain laws and regulations governing mortgage brokers in Massachusetts, including but not limited to, compliance with timing requirements in which certain disclosures must be provided to consumers. 	 C. Providing Mortgage Lender Disclosures to Consumers  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection indicate that Miracle Mortgage, a mortgage broker, provided mortgage lender disclosures to consumers in violation of and exceeding its authority under G. L. c. 255E.  The mortgage lender disclosures include, but are not limited to, Equal Credit Opportunity Notices, and Notice to Applicant of Right to Receive Copy of Appraisal Report. 	 D. Failure to Provide Notification of the Closing of a Licensed Office Location  The Division's Regulation 209 CMR 42.13(2) states: 	 Licensees shall provide thirty days prior written notice of any change or closing of a Massachusetts location to the Commissioner and shall contain such other information as the Commissioner may require.  During the 2008 examination/inspection, representatives of Miracle Mortgage notified the Division's examiners that the Corporation was in the process of relocating to a new location and such relocation would be effective as of June 1, 2008. As of May 21, 2008, the date upon which the 2008 examination/inspection was initiated, the Division had not received written notice of the relocation of the main office location. 	 E. Other Violations  In addition to the violations specifically set forth in this Temporary Order, a Report of Examination/Inspection on Consumer Compliance prepared as of May 21, 2008 and to be provided to Miracle Mortgage in conjunction with the issuance of this Temporary Order, describes other violations and areas of concern observed during the 2008 examination/inspection. 	 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 20, Miracle Mortgage has failed to demonstrate and maintain the character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the mortgage broker business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 20, by altering loan documentation including income, asset and employment information related to the loan approval process, Miracle Mortgage has violated on numerous occasions the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(8), Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) and the Office of the Attorney General's implementing regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 20, by failing to keep and use its books and records in a manner which would allow the Commissioner to determine whether the Corporation was complying with applicable state and federal laws and regulations, Miracle Mortgage has violated the Division's regulations 209 CMR 48.03 and 209 CMR 42.09(1).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 20, by providing disclosures to consumers that only lenders are authorized to provide Miracle Mortgage has exceeded its authority as a mortgage broker in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 20, by failing to notify the Commissioner, in writing, at least thirty days prior to a relocation of the licensed office, Miracle Mortgage violated the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.13(2).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 20, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 Miracle Mortgage has engaged in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that the Corporation is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage broker including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00 et seq.  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to Miracle Mortgage.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 20, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of Miracle Mortgage original mortgage broker license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 20, present sufficient grounds for the revocation of Miracle Mortgage broker licenses pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.07(2)(b) and 42.12A(19). 	 ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that Miracle Mortgage and any and all officers, members, managers, employees, independent contractors, or agents, operating on behalf of Miracle Mortgage, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of: (a) a mortgage broker, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, and (b) a mortgage loan originator, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Temporary Order. Therefore, Miracle Mortgage is ordered to immediately cease soliciting or accepting, either directly or indirectly, any residential mortgage loan applications from consumers for residential property located in Massachusetts.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, that Miracle Mortgage shall immediately place any fees previously collected from Massachusetts consumers, relative to any pending mortgage loan applications accepted at any office location, into a separate escrow account, designated for such purpose and maintained at a federally insured bank. In addition, Miracle Mortgage shall adopt or revise, as applicable, policies and procedures to ensure adherence to all regulations concerning the maintenance of such escrow account under 209 CMR 42.11.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Miracle Mortgage shall immediately place with one or more qualified broker(s) or lender(s), as appropriate based on the status of the application and with no loss to applicants, all of its pending Massachusetts residential mortgage loan applications. Miracle Mortgage shall obtain the prior approval of the Commissioner before placing such applications to the qualified broker(s) or lender(s).  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Miracle Mortgage shall submit to the Commissioner a detailed record, prepared as of the date of submission, of all of the Corporation's pending residential mortgage loan applications on property located in Massachusetts. The records to be produced shall be submitted to the Commissioner within five (5) days of the effective date of this Temporary Order and shall include all information on file, regarding the Corporation's open application list, including but not necessarily limited to, the following: 	 All information on file as of the date of submission regarding Miracle Mortgage's open application list as a mortgage broker, including but not limited to, the following: The names of all individuals from whom Miracle Mortgage has accepted an application for a residential mortgage loan; the applicants' addresses and telephone numbers; the amount of all prepaid loan fees submitted by the customer; the amount of each loan; application status (i.e. filed, submitted to lenders, cleared to close, etc.); scheduled closing dates; rate lock status; and a list identifying the applicable broker or lender with whom the applicants' application was placed. The latter list should include telephone numbers of contact persons familiar with the Corporation's submitted loans.  Miracle Mortgage shall immediately secure all pending residential mortgage loan application files and, to the extent that any original documents must be forwarded to the relevant mortgage lender(s) and or mortgage broker(s) pursuant to Paragraph 30 of this Temporary Order, a copy of such document, correspondence, or paper relating to the mortgage loan shall be retained in Miracle Mortgage's books and records and shall be available to the Commissioner, in their entirety, upon request.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Temporary Order shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under General Laws chapter 30A.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Temporary Order shall not be construed as approving any act, practice, or conduct not specifically set forth herein which was, is, or may be in violation of relevant state or federal laws and regulations. The findings, conclusions, and required action set forth in this Temporary Order are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any findings, conclusions, and corrective action which may be set forth in the Report of Examination/Inspection, prepared by the Division of Banks as of May 21, 2008.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such Temporary Order shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from Miracle Mortgage within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this Temporary Order. If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this Temporary Order shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.     BY ORDER AND DIRECTION OF THE COMMISSIONER OF BANKS.

79,2/25/2021,2009,Temporary Cease and Desist,Maniflo Money Exchange Inc.,Foreign Transmittal Agency,Failure to post required bond,Wilton Manors FL,https://www.mass.gov/cease-order/maniflo-money-exchange-inc-temporary-cease-and-desist-order," 1.                 The Division of Banks (“Division”), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons engaged in the business of a foreign transmittal agency pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169.  2.                 Maniflo Money Exchange is, and at all relevant times has been, a foreign corporation conducting business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.    Maniflo Money Exchange’s main office is located at 1422 Highland Avenue, National City, California.  3.                 Maniflo Money Exchange  is licensed by the Commissioner as a foreign transmittal agency under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169.    According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a foreign transmittal license to Maniflo Money Exchange on or about April 3, 2007, with license number FT5380.    License number FT5380 authorized Maniflo Money Exchange to operate as a foreign transmittal agency at 422 Main Street, Woburn, Massachusetts.  4.                 Maniflo Money Exchange maintains three additional foreign transmittal licenses for three agent businesses or authorized delegates, for locations operated in the Commonwealth from which the Corporation conducts its foreign transmittal business.    According to the Division’s records, license number FT5897, was issued to the Corporation on or about January 15, 2008 for a location operated at 111 Foster Street, Peabody, Massachusetts.    License number FT5898 was issued to Maniflo Money Exchange on or about January 15, 2008 for a location operated at 376 Mystic Avenue, Somerville, Massachusetts.    License number FT6019 was issued to the Corporation on or about March 21, 2008 for a location operation at 19 Mill Street, Lowell, Massachusetts.     5.                 Maniflo Money Exchange is a money service business within the meaning of The Bank Secrecy Act and its implementing regulation at 31 C.F.R. Part 103 .  6.                 Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169, section 10, the Division conducted an inspection of the books, accounts, papers, records, and files of Maniflo Money Exchange on October 27, 2008 (the “2008 examination/inspection”).  7.                 The Division's Report of Examination/Inspection on Consumer Compliance (the ""Report""), which was issued to Maniflo Money Exchange on the effective date of this Temporary Order, presented the findings of the 2008 examination/inspection and alleged significant failures to comply with applicable state and federal laws, rules, regulations, and regulatory bulletins governing the conduct of those engaged in the business of a foreign transmittal agency in Massachusetts.  A.      Failure to Demonstrate the Financial Responsibility, Character, Reputation, Integrity, and General Fitness to Maintain a FOREIGN tRANSMITTAL agency License  8.                 Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169, section 12 relevant to the licensing of foreign transmittal agencies states:  The commissioner may suspend or revoke any license issued pursuant to this chapter if he finds that: (a) the licensee has violated any provision of this chapter or any rule or regulation adopted hereunder or any other law applicable to the conduct of such business; or (b) any fact or condition exists which, if it had existed at the time of the original application for such license, would have warranted the commissioner to refuse to issue such license.  9.                 Books and records reviewed by the Division’s examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that Maniflo Money Exchange suffered significant operating losses totaling approximately $2,914,325 for the interim period beginning December 31, 2007 and ending September 30, 2008.    A review of the financial statements provided to the Division’s examiners for review during the 2008 examination/inspection indicated that the financial viability of Maniflo Money Exchange was questionable due to the sale of seventy five (75) percent of the Corporation’s operations to a competitor and Maniflo Money Exchange’s management has not developed any plans to offset the significant losses incurred to date or replace the lost revenue stream.     10.              The Division’s regulation at 209 CMR 44.04(1)states in part:                     (2)(a) The Commissioner may deny an application to engage in the business of foreign transmittal agency, if the Commissioner upon review of the application and other relevant information, determines that the Applicant has not satisfied the requirements of M.G.L. c. 169 or 209 CMR 44.03.                          (b) The Commissioner may also deny such an application if the Applicant has:                     1. violated any provision of M.G.L. c. 169 or 209 CMR 44.00;                     2. violated or engaged in a pattern of violations of any state or federal law applicable to the conduct of the business of a foreign transmittal agency and any rule, regulation or administrative order or directive promulgated thereunder;                     3. conducted, or will conduct, its business in an unsafe and unsound manner…  11.              Books and records reviewed by the Division’s examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that Maniflo Money Exchange failed to meet the minimum financial responsibility requirements    necessary to maintain a foreign transmittal agency license in the Commonwealth; failed to receive approval of a Massachusetts branch closing; failed to implement an effective anti money laundering program as required by The Bank Secrecy Act’s (BSA’s) (31 U.S.C § 5311  et seq.)  implementing regulatory requirements; and conducted business with unlicensed entities as more specifically enumerated in this Temporary Order and in the Examiner’s Comments and Conclusions section of the Report.  B.      Failure to Provide Information Requested Pursuant to The Division’s    Inspection of the Corporation     12.              Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169, section 10 states in part:  A licensee shall keep such books, accounts and records as will enable the commissioner to  determine  whether such licensee is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter and rules and regulations made pursuant thereto  and  any other law, rule and regulation applicable to the conduct of such business…  A licensee shall, when directed by the commissioner, permit the commissioner or his duly authorized representative to inspect its records and evidence of compliance with this chapter or any rule or regulation issued thereunder and with any other law, rule and regulation applicable to the conduct of its business…  13.              The Division’s regulation 209 CMR 44.05(1) states:  Each Licensee [foreign transmittal agency] shall keep and use within the Commonwealth its books, records and accounts in a manner which will allow the Commissioner to determine whether the Licensee is complying with the provisions of M.G.L. c[hapter] 169.  14.              During the 2008 examination/inspection, the Division’s examiners requested information pertaining to financial records and current litigation that Maniflo Money Exchange may have been involved in.    Maniflo Money Exchange was unwilling to produce the requested books and records despite repeated requests by the Division’s examiners.    As of the date of this Temporary Order, the Corporation has failed to fully comply with the Division’s requests.  C.      Failure to obtain prior approval of the closing of a branch location  15.              The Division’s regulation 209 CMR 44.09(2) states in part:  Licensees shall obtain the Commissioner’s written prior approval of any change in or closing of Massachusetts location.    Written application to the Commissioner shall be made prior to any such change or closing and shall contain such other information as the Commissioner may require  16.              During the 2008 examination/inspection, the Division’s examiners were advised by the management of Maniflo Money Exchange that the Corporation’s relationship with the Lowell branch location, Global Help Center, Inc., license number FT6019, had been terminated, however, the Division’s records indicate that as of the date of this Temporary Order the Corporation has not requested nor received written approval of the closure of the Lowell branch location.     D.      Failure to Implement an Effective Anti-Money Laundering Program  17.              The BSA’s  implementing regulation at 31 C.F.R. § 103.125 states, in part:                     (a) Each money services  business  . . . shall develop, implement and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program . . . .    that is reasonably designed to prevent the money services business from being used to facilitate money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities.                     (b) The program shall be commensurate with the risks posed by the location and size of, and the nature and volume of the financial services provided by, the money services business.  18.              The BSA’s  implementing  regulation at 31 C.F.R. § 103.125(d) requires all money services businesses including but not limited to a foreign transmittal agency such as Maniflo Money Exchange to implement written anti-money laundering policies and procedures that, at a minimum: (1) incorporate policies and procedures and internal controls reasonably designed to assure compliance with this part, including requirements verifying customer identification, filing reports, creating and retaining records, and responding to law enforcement requests;    (2) designate a person to assure day to day compliance with the program; (3) provide for education and/or training of appropriate personnel, including training in the detection of suspicious transactions; and (4) provide for independent review to monitor and maintain an adequate program.  I.            Policies, Procedures and Internal Controls                     a.       Failure to Identify, and Adequately Respond to a Pattern of Suspicious Activity  19.              Books and Records reviewed by the Division’s examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that Maniflo Money Exchange’s anti-money laundering program was seriously deficient as the Corporation failed to implement effective internal controls; and effectuate integral policies and procedures related to minimal customer identification requirements, reporting practices and recordkeeping requirements to ensure a minimal level of compliance with BSA requirements as more specifically enumerated in this Temporary Order and in the Examiner’s Comments and Conclusions section of the Report.  20.              The Division’s examiners determined that the failure to establish an effective anti-money laundering  program  resulted in the Corporation’s failure to identify, and adequately respond to a pattern of suspicious activity, including but not limited to conducting business with unlicensed entities, structuring, and unlicensed transmittals by the Corporation’s branch locations, that would have been identified had the Corporation established a reasonable anti-money laundering program outlined in BSA’s implementing regulations.  21.              The Division’s examiners found evidence in the form of receipts, that the Corporation’s agent businesses or authorized delegates,  Global Help Center, Inc., license number FT6019, and Gol Latino Market, license number FT5380 were engaged in the practice of conducting illegal transmittals through money remitters unrelated to Maniflo Money Exchange or any other licensed money remitter.  This includes four transactions with Global Help Center, Inc., during September 2008, and one transaction with Gol Latino Market during May 2008, as more specifically enumerated in the Examiner’s Comments and Conclusions section of the Report.                          b.         Failure to Implement Adequate Customer Identification Procedures  22.              Books and records reviewed by the Division’s examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection indicated that one licensed location of Maniflo Money Exchange processed at least 206 transactions totaling $801,845.31 between April 1, 2007 and June 15, 2007.    A review of the transactions revealed that Maniflo Money Exchange' would routinely collect funds from its agents who had collected the funds from unknown and unlicensed third parties who failed to verify the customer’s identity.    The Division’s examiners determined that the Corporation  would  thereafter process the transmittal requests from the unknown and unlicensed third parties and record incomplete or fictitious customer names and addresses for those customers utilizing the services of the unlicensed third parties.  23.              Books and records reviewed by the Division’s examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that although Maniflo Money Exchange’s written policy required    verification of the customers, names addresses and telephone numbers, a review of transactions that occurred between March 17, 2007 and September 30, 2008 indicated that the Corporation failed to  implement  and follow those written procedures and the majority of the transactions initiated by agent businesses or authorized delegates and ultimately processed by the Corporation were in violation of the written policies.                      c.        Failure to Implement Adequate Reporting Requirements   24.              The  BSA’s  implementing  regulation at 31 C.F.R. § 103.22(b)(1) states, in part:  Each  financial  institution other than a casino shall file a report of each deposit, withdrawal, exchange of currency or other payment or transfer, by, through, or to such financial institution which involves a transaction in currency of more than $10,000 . . .   25.              The BSA’s implementing regulation at 31 C.F.R. § 103.27(a)(1) states:  A report required by § 103.22(a) shall be filed by the financial institution within 15 days following the day on which the reportable transaction occurred.  26.              Books and records reviewed by the Division’s examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that Maniflo Money Exchange’s written guidelines for identifying,  reporting  and ultimately filing Currency Transaction Report (“CTR”) forms were critically deficient and ineffective, as the Corporation’s failure to implement proper procedures mandating the verification of customers identities rendered the filing of any CTR’s filed likely inaccurate and ineffective.  27.              The BSA’s implementing regulation at 31 C.F.R. § 103.20(a)(1) states, in part:  Every money services business . . . shall file with the Treasury Department, to the extent and in the manner required by this section, a report of any suspicious transaction relevant to a possible violation of law or regulation . . .  28.              The  BSA’s  implementing regulation at 31 C.F.R. § 103.20(a)(2) states, in part:  A transaction requires reporting under the terms of this section if it is conducted or attempted by, at, or through a money services business, involves or aggregates funds or other assets of at least $2,000… and the money services business knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect that the transaction (or a pattern of transactions of which the transaction is a part):… (ii) Is designed, whether through structuring or other means, to evade any requirements of this part or of any other regulations promulgated under the Bank Secrecy Act, Public Law 91-508, as amended, codified at 12 U.S.C. 1829b, 12 U.S.C. 1951-1959, and 31 U.S.C. 5311- 5330; or (iii) Serves no business or apparent lawful purpose, and the reporting money services business knows of no reasonable explanation for the transaction after examining the available facts, including the background and possible purpose of the transaction.    (iv) Involves use of the money service business to facilitate criminal activity.  29.              Books and records reviewed by the Division’s examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection identified several suspicious transactions that would have required the filing of Suspicious Activity Reports by Money Services Business (“SAR-MSBs”), had Maniflo Money Exchange’s written policies been appropriately implemented.  30.              The Division’s examiner’s identified at least two  transactions  each in the amount of $4,999 initiated by one customer and remitted to one beneficiary over the course of approximately ten minutes that Maniflo Money Exchange should have known, suspected, or had reason to suspect was suspicious.    Specifically, the Corporation should have had reason to suspect that the transactions were designed to evade the reporting requirements of the BSA.    The transactions identified by the examiners are specifically set forth in the Report and are incorporated herein by reference.                        d.       Failure to Establish Adequate Recordkeeping Procedures   31.              The BSA’s implementing regulation at 31 C.F.R. § 103.33(f)(1)(i) states in part:  For each transmittal order that it accepts as a transmittor’s financial institution, a financial institution shall obtain and retain either the original or a microfilm, other copy, or electronic record of the following information relating to the transmittal order:                     (A)    The name and address of the    transmittor;                     (B)    The amount of the transmittal order;                     (C)    The execution date of the transmittal order;                     (D)    Any payment instruction received from the transmitter with the transmittal order                     (E)     The identity of the recipients’ financial institutions;                     (F)     As many of the following items as are received with the transmittal order...  32.              Books and records reviewed by the Division’s examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that Maniflo Money Exchange’s recordkeeping policies and procedures were ineffective and deficient as the Corporation failed to document the address of at least two transmittors.    The records reviewed by the Division’s examiners also indicate that additional transmittor information recorded by the Corporation in unrelated transactions appeared to be questionable as more specifically described in the Examiner’s Comments and Conclusions section of the Report.  II.            Education and Training  33.              The  BSA’s  implementing regulation at 103 C.F.R. § 103.125(d)(3) states:  The money services business’ anti-money laundering program shall [p]rovide education and/or training of appropriate personnel concerning their responsibilities under the program, including training in the detection of suspicious transactions to the extent that the money services business is required to report such transactions under this part.  34.              According to information provided to the Division’s examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection, Maniflo Money Exchange’s training program sets out training and education requirements for new hires and ongoing training for employees.    Maniflo Money Exchange’s initial training is a combination of a review of the Corporation’s compliance manual and a PowerPoint presentation of both BSA and Anti Money Laundering (“AML”) requirements      Maniflo Money Exchange indicated that all trainees are required to acknowledge attendance by signing an acknowledgement form, all of which are maintained at the Corporation’s main office in National City, California.    During the 2008 examination/inspection Maniflo Money Exchange provided the Division’s examiners with acknowledgement forms that were apparently faxed from at least two Massachusetts agent businesses or authorized delegates indicating that BSA and The Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) training had been completed in May 2008.    However, during the 2008 examination/inspection, information received from the agent businesses or authorized delegates was contrary to  that  provided by the Corporation as both agent businesses or authorized delegates indicated that they had only been shown how to utilize the Corporation’s software program and had received no other training.  35.                The findings of the 2008 examination/inspection indicate that, in practice, the training program  purportedly  established by Maniflo Money Exchange does not effectively ensure that all personnel were adequately trained as evidenced by the Corporation’s failure comply with the minimal BSA anti money laundering program requirements as more specifically explained in this Temporary Order and in the Examiner’s Comments and Conclusions section of the Report.     III.             Designated Compliance Officer  36.              The  BSA’s  implementing regulation at 31 C.F.R. § 103.125(d)(2) states, in part:  [The money services business’ anti-money laundering program shall] [d] esignate a person to assure day to day compliance with the program and this part.    The responsibilities of such person shall include assuring that:    (i) The money services business properly files reports, and creates and retains records, in accordance with applicable requirements of this part; (ii) The compliance program is updated as necessary to reflect current requirements of this part, and related guidance issued by the Department of the Treasury; and (iii) The money services business provides appropriate training and education in accordance with paragraph (d)(3) of this section.  37.              Maniflo Money Exchange has designated a compliance officer; however, the examination/inspection revealed that the compliance officer failed to effectively perform the required duties necessary for that position.    Specifically, as explained in more detail in this Temporary Order  and  in the Examiner’s Comments and Conclusions section of the Report, the compliance officer failed to ensure that Maniflo Money Exchange properly identified suspicious transactions that would require the filing of SAR-MSBs under 31 C.F.R. § 103.20 and failed to ensure that the Corporation properly filed CTRs as required pursuant to 31 C.F.R. § 103.22.  IV.             Independent Review  38.              The BSA’s implementing regulation at 31 C.F.R. § 103.125(d)(4) states:  [The money services business’ anti-money laundering program shall] [p]rovide for independent review to monitor and maintain an adequate program. The scope and frequency of the review shall be commensurate with the risk of the financial services provided by the money services business.    Such review may be conducted by an officer or employee of the money services business so long as the reviewer is not the person designated in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.  39.              The examination/inspection revealed that Maniflo Money Exchange’s independent review was ineffective and not commensurate with the risk of the financial services provided by the Corporation.    A review of the independent audit revealed that the scope of the independent testing was limited, and failed to include transaction testing of the agents, customers and beneficiaries and resulted in an ineffective and incomplete evaluation of the adequacy of the Corporation’s anti-money laundering program.    Additionally, the Division’s examiners determined that there was no evidence that the independent audit evaluated the policies and procedures established by Maniflo Money Exchange’s oversight of the Corporation’s  agent businesses or authorized delegates.  40.              Books and records reviewed by the Division’s examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that there is no evidence that the review evaluated Maniflo Money Exchange’s policies and procedures for identifying suspicious transactions as required by 3 1 C.F.R. § 103.20.    Moreover, the audit failed to identify easily recognizable weaknesses in the compliance program such as failure to develop, implement and maintain a written anti-money laundering program that fully complies with 31 C.F.R. § 103.125.  E.      maintaining Business Relationships with Unlicensed Foreign Agents   41.              The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network Interpretative Release, 2004-1 (“2004-1 Interpretative Release”) requires money service business agents utilizing foreign agents to incorporate “certain risk-based policies, procedures and controls designed to identify and minimize money laundering and terrorist financing risks associated with foreign agents and counterparties that facilitate the flow of funding into and out of the United States.”  42.              The 2004-1 Interpretative Release states in part:  A Money [s]ervices [b]usiness’ anti-money program should include procedures for the following…(1) Conduct of Due Diligence on Foreign Agents and Counterparties…(2) Risk-based monitoring for Foreign Agents or Counterparties…(3) Corrective Action and Termination.  43.              Books and records reviewed by the Division’s examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that Maniflo Money Exchange failed to comply with the 2004-1 Interpretive Release guidelines by consistently utilizing a Brazilian entity, that was not organized, licensed or chartered legally to legally act as a foreign agent or counterparty in Brazil.    During the 2008 examination/inspection, Maniflo Money Exchange’s management acknowledged the relationship with the unlicensed entity, and indicated that the Corporation was aware that the entity was not authorized by the Brazilian authorities to act as a paying agent.  44.              Books and records reviewed by the Division’s examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that Maniflo Money Exchange failed to incorporate any risk based policies, procedures or controls identified in the 2004-1 Interpretive Release and frequently received payment instructions from the unlicensed Brazilian entity to reconcile funds paid to beneficiaries in Brazil.    Instead of remitting the funds to intended recipient, payment instructions from agents often required Maniflo Money Exchange to transfer funds to numerous other parties that had no connection to the customer initiating the transmittal.    In one particular transaction reviewed, Maniflo Money Exchange was required to wire funds to an appliance company based in China, however, the company maintained an account in Brazil and an intermediary account in New York.  45.              During the 2008 examination/inspection, representatives of Maniflo Money Exchange indicated to the Division’s examiners that the Corporation visited the unlicensed Brazilian entity annually however failed to document any findings or produce any due diligence reports produced as a result of these visits.     F.       OTHER  VIOLATIONS   46.              In addition to the violations specifically set forth in this Temporary Order, a Report of Examination/Inspection on Consumer Compliance prepared as of October 27, 2008 and to be provided to Maniflo Money Exchange in conjunction with the issuance of this Temporary Order, describes other violations observed during the 2008 examination/inspection.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE BROKER  LICENSING  Docket No. 2009-004  FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  MORTGAGE FUNDING CORP.  Pembroke, Massachusetts  Mortgage Broker License No. MB5024  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that MORTGAGE FUNDING CORP., (""Mortgage Funding"" or the ""Corporation""), located at 15 Columbia Road, Unit 9, Pembroke, Massachusetts, has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""Temporary Order"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  Mortgage Funding is, and at all relevant times has been, a Massachusetts Corporation doing business in the Commonwealth. Mortgage Funding's main office is located at 15 Columbia Road, Unit 9, Pembroke, Massachusetts.  Mortgage Funding is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage lender license, license number ML0013 to Mortgage Funding to engage in the business of a mortgage lender on or about December 23, 1991. On or about June 3, 1998, the Commissioner issued a mortgage broker license, license number MB0864 to Mortgage Funding to engage in the business of a mortgage broker in Massachusetts. On or about May 31, 2003, the Commissioner issued a consolidated mortgage lender and mortgage broker license to the Corporation, with license number MC0013. License number MC0013 authorized Mortgage Funding to conduct the mortgage company business in Massachusetts. On or about December 4, 2007  ,  Mortgage Funding surrendered the Corporation's mortgage lender license, and retained the Corporation's mortgage broker license. Mortgage broker license, license number MB5024, authorized Mortgage Funding to engage in the business of a mortgage broker in Massachusetts at the Corporation's main office located at 15 Columbia Road, Unit 9, Pembroke, Massachusetts.  Mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers in Massachusetts are licensed and regulated under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, which is administered and enforced by the Commissioner. Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division is authorized to inspect the books, accounts, papers, records, and files of mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers transacting business in Massachusetts to determine compliance with the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E or any rule, or regulation issued thereunder, and with any law, rule, or regulation applicable to the conduct of the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker.  On November 18, 2008, pursuant to the authority granted under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division commenced an examination/inspection of the books, accounts, papers, records, and files maintained by Mortgage Funding (the ""2008 examination/inspection""). The 2008 examination/inspection included a review of Mortgage Funding's compliance with the laws and regulations governing both mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers as the books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners included a sample of those loans closed by Mortgage Funding prior to the Corporation's surrender of its mortgage lender license. The 2008 examination/inspection was conducted on-site at the Corporation's main office in Pembroke, Massachusetts.  The Division's Report of Examination/Inspection on Consumer Compliance (the ""Report""), which was issued to Mortgage Funding on the effective date of this Temporary Order, presented the findings of the 2008 examination/inspection and alleged significant failures to comply with applicable state and federal laws, rules, regulations, and regulatory bulletins governing the conduct of those engaged in the business of a mortgage broker and mortgage lender in Massachusetts. 	 A. Unfair or Deceptive Acts and Practices  False and/or Misleading Representations of Prospective Borrowers' Income  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(8), effective as of September, 8, 2006, states: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker of mortgage lender to falsify income or asset information on a mortgage loan application or mortgage loan documents.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) states: 	 Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1) states, in part: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to make any representation or statement of fact if the representation or statement is false or misleading or has the tendency or capacity to be misleading.  Books and records reviewed during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that Mortgage Funding submitted to lenders and/or investors, loan files which contained Uniform Residential Loan Applications (""1003 Form"") in which the applicants' financial information including but not limited to applicants' income, assets, and/or employment information differed significantly and was not supported by the information reflected on other pertinent documentation which Mortgage Funding had in its possession. Examples include but are not limited to the following: 	 Loan No.(s): 0088415807 and 0088415815: 		 Copies of two final stated income loan applications for first and second purchase money loans prepared by Mortgage Funding for loans which ultimately closed on November 30, 2005, indicated that the borrower, an engineer with a construction consulting firm, earned approximately $6,000 monthly or $72,000 annually. The co-borrower noted on the applications also an engineer at the construction consulting firm earned approximately $7,000 or $84,000 annually.  A pre-application form located in the loan file reflected the borrower's annual salary as $41,000 and the co-borrower's annual salary as $65,000.  A debt-to-income ratio worksheet, prepared by the corporation and maintained in the loan file reviewed by the Division's examiners, reflected the borrower's annual salary as $41,000 and the co-borrower's annual salary as $65,000.  A copy of the Corporation's loan submission through the automated underwriter system located in the loan file maintained by Mortgage Funding, reflected the borrower's base employment income as $3,417 monthly or $41,000 annually and the co-borrower's base employment income as $5,416 monthly or $65,000 annually.  The discrepancy between the information reflected on the loan applications, the pre-application form and the debt-to-income ratio worksheet located in the loan file maintained by Mortgage Funding revealed that the Corporation overstated the annual income by approximately $50,000.  A copy of a loan file for a full documentation refinance transaction for a loan ultimately closed by Mortgage Funding as the lender of record on May 16, 2006 confirmed the overstatement upon review of pay stubs and W-2 statements located in the loan file.  Loan No.(s): 0158001537 and 1337084: 		 Copies of two final stated income loan applications for first and second purchase money loans prepared by Mortgage Funding for loans which ultimately closed on January 31, 2007 indicated that the borrower, an owner of a computer repair and support service store, earned approximately $8,750 monthly or $105,000 annually. The loan applications also reflected a $20,000 account balance at a local bank.  Copies of e-mail correspondence from the borrower to the loan originator of record revealed that, on September 6, 2006 and September 7, 2006, the borrower sent e-mails that indicated that his previous year's gross income was $48,000 and his wife income as $41,000. The borrower also stated that their savings account balance was $3000-$4,000.  The discrepancy between the information reflected on the loan applications and the e-mail correspondence indicates that the borrower's income was overstated by $57,000.  Loan No.: 161047309: 		 A copy of a stated income loan application prepared by Mortgage Funding, for a loan that ultimately closed on December 30, 2005 indicated that the borrower, a medical assistant earned approximately $5,100 monthly or $61,200.  A pay stub located in the loan file maintained by Mortgage Funding indicated that for the period ending April 30, 2005 the borrower was paid an hourly rate of $16.95 and earned a gross year-to-date income of $11,885 with gross overtime income of $1,063.93.  Two W-2 statements located in the loan file reflected earnings of $12,792.58 in 2004 and $36,425.32 in 2003.  A 1099 statement located in the loan file maintained by Mortgage Funding reflected a pension distribution of $11,000 in 2004.  A ""2004 Tax Return Summary"" statement reflected a total income of $24,451 in 2004 and $37,089 in 2003.  The discrepancy between the information reflected on the loan application and the April 30, 2005 pay stub, indicates that the borrower's income was overstated by $25,545.  The practices referenced in the Paragraph above were found in the following loan additional transactions reviewed by the Division's examiners: Loan Nos: 	 (a). 131073805 and 301494675-4; (b). 3015337219; (c). 0001259377 and 0001259396; (d). 149879727 and 149879927; (e). 3500012254; and (f). 301530217. The examiners' specific findings are fully described in the Report and are incorporated herein by reference.  Mortgage Funding knew or should have known that the above referenced income and/or asset information would be relied upon in by the mortgage lender, financial institution or investor to which the mortgage loans were brokered and/or sold by Mortgage Funding. 	 B. Undisclosed Fees  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 183, section 63 states, in part: 	 A mortgagee, or a mortgage lender or mortgage broker as defined in section one of chapter two hundred and fifty-five E, shall not charge a loan fee, finder's fee, points, so-called, or similar fees in a mortgage transaction involving residential property located in the commonwealth of four or less units and occupied in whole or in part by the mortgagor, except to the extent that such fees or points have been previously disclosed to the mortgagor in writing, which disclosure may be in the form required by section seventeen D of chapter one hundred and eighty-four, or such other form which discloses said fees or points. A mortgagor shall not be obligated to pay fees or points which have not been previously disclosed as required herein.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection indicate that when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker, Mortgage Funding collected broker fees at the loan closing in amounts which the Corporation's books and records failed to document had been fully and accurately disclosed to consumers, in writing, in the amounts charged at closing, if at all, as more fully described in the Report. 	 C. Providing Mortgage Lender Disclosures to Consumers  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection indicate that Mortgage Funding, when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker routinely provided several mortgage lender disclosures to consumers, including but not limited to, Equal Credit Opportunity Notices, Truth in Lending Statements, Adjustable Rate Mortgage and Interest Only Program Disclosures and Borrower's Interest Determination Worksheets. Such activity was in excess of the Corporation's authority as a mortgage broker, pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. 	 D. Misleading Statements  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1) states, in part: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to make any representation or statement of fact if the representation or statement is false or misleading, or has the tendency or capacity to be misleading.  Books and records reviewed during the 2008 examination revealed that when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker, Mortgage Funding provided applicants with a Borrower's Certification and Authorization Form that contained language that was false or misleading or had the tendency or capacity to be false or misleading. Specifically, the Borrower's Certification and Authorization Form contained language which presented the appearance that Mortgage Funding, was approving or funding the mortgage loan by indicating that the Corporation would be able to sell the mortgage loan to an investor. 	 E. Refinancing in the Borrower's Interest  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 183, section 28C(a) states in part: 	 A lender shall not knowingly make a home loan if the home loan pays off all or part of an existing home loan that was consummated within the prior 60 months or other debt of the borrower, unless the refinancing is in the borrower's interest. The ""borrower's interest"" shall be narrowly construed, and the burden is upon the lender to determine that the refinancing is in the borrower's interest.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 53.07(1)(b) states in part: 	 A lender may request that a borrower acknowledge receipt of such a worksheet or other documentation; provided, however, a lender shall not shift the burden to the borrower to demonstrate that a home loan is in the borrowers' interest.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that Mortgage Funding, when acting in the capacity of a mortgage lender provided consumers with a ""Statement of Borrower's Benefit Applicability and Borrower's Interest Determination Worksheet (""Statement""), which required borrowers to acknowledge and affirm that the mortgage loan was not subject to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 183, section 28C(a).  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that the language used in the Statement provided to the applicable consumers was not in compliance with 209 CMR 53.07(1)(b) inasmuch as it shifted the burden to the borrowers to demonstrate that the loan was in their interest and to their benefit.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination revealed that Mortgage Funding, while licensed as only a mortgage broker continued to provide applicants with a ""Massachusetts Mortgage Loan Benefit Worksheet"" form (""Worksheet""), a document that only mortgage lenders are authorized to provide to borrowers pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 183, section 28C(a). 	 F. Engaging in Prohibited Advertising Practices  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.04(1) states: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to make any representation or statement of fact in an advertisement if the representation or statement is false or misleading or has the tendency or capacity to be misleading, or if the mortgage broker or lender does not have sufficient information upon which a reasonable belief in the truth of the representation or statement could be based.  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.04(4) states, in part: 	 No advertisement by a mortgage broker in any media shall contain language which indicates or suggests that the mortgage broker will fund or approve a mortgage loan or guarantee any rate.  Mortgage Funding's website contains and Equal Housing Lender logo and contains the following statements: 	 Mortgage Funding Corp. is a licensed mortgage lender in Massachusetts...

We have approved loans for people with a variety of financial or credit problems including poor credit, late payments, collections, judgments and bankruptcies.  Such representations have the tendency or capacity to mislead consumers as they present the appearance that Mortgage Funding, a mortgage broker is approving or funding loans.  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.04(4)(d) states: 	 (4) It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to engage in bait advertising or to misrepresent (directly or by failure to adequately disclose) the terms, conditions or charges incident to the mortgage loan being advertised in any advertisement. Violation of 940 CMR 8.04(4) shall include, but not be limited to:  (d) the advertisement through terms such as ""bad credit no problem"" or words of similar import or that an applicant will have unqualified access to credit without clearly and conspicuously disclosing the material limitations on the availability of credit that may exist, such as:  requirements for the availability of credit (such as income);  that a higher rate or more points may be required for a consumer with bad credit; and  that restrictions as to the maximum principal amount of the loan offered may apply.  Mortgage Funding's website contains the statement ""At Mortgage Funding Corp., we won't let your past stand in the way of your future."" The statement is located under the heading ""Less than Perfect Credit"" and presents the appearance that applicants will have unqualified access to credit and does not include the disclosure language required pursuant to 940 CMR 8.04(4)(d). 	 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 28, Mortgage Funding has failed to demonstrate and maintain the character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the mortgage broker business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 28, by falsifying borrowers' income information on Uniform Residential Loan Applications submitted in connection with residential mortgage transactions, Mortgage Funding has violated the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(8) and Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) and the Office of the Attorney General's implementing regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 28, by charging loan fees, points, or similar fees in a mortgage transaction involving residential property located in the Commonwealth, of four or less units and occupied in whole or in part by the mortgagor, in amounts exceeding those previously disclosed for such fees or points to the mortgagor in writing, Mortgage Funding has violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 183, section 63.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 28, by providing disclosures to consumers that only lenders are authorized to provide, Mortgage Funding exceeded its authority as a mortgage broker in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 28, by providing borrowers with documentation that shifted the burden to the borrowers to demonstrate that the loans were in the borrowers' interest and to their benefit, Mortgage Funding violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 183, section 28C(a) and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 53.07(1).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 28, by providing disclosures to consumers that contained language that was false or misleading or had the tendency or capacity to be false or misleading, Mortgage Funding violated the Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 28, by including statements that contained false or misleading language or had the tendency to be false or misleading, on the Corporation's website, Mortgage Funding has violated the Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.04(1).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 28, by engaging in so-called ""bait advertising"" and failing to include required disclosure language on the Corporation's website, Mortgage Funding has violated the Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.04(4).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 28, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 Mortgage Funding has engaged in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that the Corporation is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage broker including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00 et seq.  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to Mortgage Funding.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 28, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of Mortgage Funding's original mortgage broker license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 28, present sufficient grounds for the revocation of Mortgage Funding's broker license pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.07(2)(b). 	 ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that Mortgage Funding and any and all officers, members, managers, employees, independent contractors, or agents, operating on behalf of Mortgage Funding, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of: (a) a mortgage broker, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, and (b) a mortgage loan originator, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Temporary Order. Therefore, Mortgage Funding is ordered to immediately cease soliciting or accepting, either directly or indirectly, any residential mortgage loan applications from consumers for residential property located in Massachusetts.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, that Mortgage Funding shall immediately place any fees previously collected from Massachusetts consumers, relative to any pending mortgage loan applications accepted at any office location, into a separate escrow account, designated for such purpose and maintained at a federally insured bank. In addition, Mortgage Funding shall adopt or revise, as applicable, policies and procedures to ensure adherence to all regulations concerning the maintenance of such escrow account under 209 CMR 42.11.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Mortgage Funding shall immediately place with one or more qualified broker(s) or lender(s), as appropriate based on the status of the application and with no loss to applicants, all of its pending Massachusetts residential mortgage loan applications. Mortgage Funding shall obtain the prior approval of the Commissioner before placing such applications to the qualified broker(s) or lender(s).  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Mortgage Funding shall submit to the Commissioner a detailed record, prepared as of the date of submission, of all of the Corporation's pending residential mortgage loan applications on property located in Massachusetts. The records to be produced shall be submitted to the Commissioner within five (5) days of the effective date of this Temporary Order and shall include all information on file, regarding the Corporation's open application list, including but not necessarily limited to, the following: 	 All information on file as of the date of submission regarding Mortgage Funding's open application list as a mortgage broker, including but not limited to, the following: The names of all individuals from whom Mortgage Funding has accepted an application for a residential mortgage loan; the applicants' addresses and telephone numbers; the amount of all prepaid loan fees submitted by the customer; the amount of each loan; application status (i.e. filed, submitted to lenders, cleared to close, etc.); scheduled closing dates; rate lock status; and a list identifying the applicable broker or lender with whom the applicants' application was placed. The latter list should include telephone numbers of contact persons familiar with the Corporation's submitted loans.  Mortgage Funding shall immediately secure all pending residential mortgage loan application files and, to the extent that any original documents must be forwarded to the relevant mortgage lender(s) and or mortgage broker(s) pursuant to Paragraph 42 of this Temporary Order, a copy of such document, correspondence, or paper relating to the mortgage loan shall be retained in Mortgage Funding's books and records and shall be available to the Commissioner, in their entirety, upon request.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Temporary Order shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under General Laws chapter 30A.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Temporary Order shall not be construed as approving any act, practice, or conduct not specifically set forth herein which was, is, or may be in violation of relevant state or federal laws and regulations. The findings, conclusions, and required action set forth in this Temporary Order are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any findings, conclusions, and corrective action which may be set forth in the Report of Examination/Inspection, prepared by the Division of Banks as of November 18, 2008.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such Temporary Order shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from Mortgage Funding within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this Temporary Order. If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this Temporary Order shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.     BY ORDER AND DIRECTION OF THE COMMISSIONER OF BANKS.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE LENDER  MORTGAGE BROKER  LICENSING  Docket No. 2009-007  ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE  AND NOTICE OF RIGHT  TO A HEARING  In the Matter of  CASTLE POINT MORTGAGE, INC.  Elkridge, Maryland  Mortgage Company License No(s). MC5128 and MC5130  ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLAINT  The Commonwealth of Massachusetts Division of Banks (the ""Division""), by and through the Commissioner of Banks of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the ""Commissioner  "") , for its Order to Show Cause and Notice of Right to a Hearing (""Order and Notice""), alleges as follows:  The Division brings this action under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 to obtain temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief, ordering Castle Point Mortgage, Inc. (""Castle Point"" or the ""Corporation""), at all relevant times, a licensed mortgage lender and mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2 and its implementing regulation 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , to cease and desist from transacting business in the Commonwealth as a mortgage lender and/or mortgage broker; revocation of Castle Point's Massachusetts mortgage company licenses, numbers MC5128 and MC5130; and such other equitable relief as may be necessary due to Castle Point's failure to maintain and exercise the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that its business will be operated honestly, fairly, soundly, and efficiently in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.03(2)(c) and 42.06(2)(c). 	 JURISDICTION AND VENUE  The Division, through the Commissioner, is an agency of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts with jurisdiction over matters relating to the licensing and operation of those engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2 and Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8.  At all relevant times, Castle Point has been engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker of residential property (""Residential property"" means real property located in the Commonwealth having thereon a dwelling house with accommodations for four or less separate households and occupied, or to be occupied, in whole or in part by the obligor on the mortgage debt pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1.) in Massachusetts. 	 RESPONDENT  At all relevant times, Castle Point was a foreign corporation doing business in the Commonwealth with its main office located at 6800 Deerpath Road, Suite 105, Elkridge, Maryland. On July 2, 2008, Castle Point filed a Foreign Certificate of Withdrawal with the Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth, thus surrendering its authority to transact business in Massachusetts.  Castle Point was licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage lender and mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage broker license, license number MB2718, to Castle Point to engage in the business of a mortgage broker on or about July 23, 2002.  According to records maintained on file with the Division, as of March 2008, Castle Point held two mortgage company licenses for office locations in Elkridge, Maryland and Parsippany, New Jersey with license numbers MC5128 and MC5130, respectively. Division records indicate that the Commissioner issued the mortgage company licenses for both of those locations on or about December 11, 2007. (According to Division records, Castle Point has held various licenses, including both mortgage lender and mortgage company licenses, for office locations located within and without the Commonwealth since the date of initial licensure. Castle Point had continuously held at least one mortgage license since the date of its initial licensure until petitioning to surrender its Massachusetts licenses in July 2008.)  On or about December 11, 2007, Castle Point was issued a mortgage company license, license number MC5129 to engage in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker. License number MC5129 authorized Castle Point to conduct the mortgage company business from the Corporation's office located at One Tech Drive, Suite 320, Andover, Massachusetts. License number MC5129 was surrendered by the Corporation on January 24, 2008.  By letter dated July 8, 2008, Castle Point notified the Division that the Corporation intended to surrender its mortgage company licenses for its offices located in Elkridge, Maryland and Parsippany, New Jersey with license numbers MC5128 and MC5130, respectively. The Corporation also attached the original license certificates. The Corporation subsequently requested the surrender of its licenses via the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System (NMLS) as of July 24, 2008. 	 REGULATORY BACKGROUND  Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division is authorized to inspect the books, accounts, papers, records, and files of mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers transacting business in Massachusetts to determine compliance with the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E and any rule, or regulation issued thereunder, and with any law, rule, or regulation applicable to the conduct of the business of a mortgage lender or mortgage broker.  On March 10, 2008, pursuant to the authority granted under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division commenced an examination/inspection of the books, accounts, papers, records, and files maintained by Castle Point to evaluate the Corporation's compliance with the laws, regulations, and regulatory bulletins applicable to the conduct of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker business in Massachusetts (the ""2008 examination/inspection"").  The Division's Report of Examination/Inspection (the ""Report""), was issued to Castle Point on the effective date of this Order and Notice and alleged significant failures to comply with applicable state and federal laws, rules, regulations, and regulatory bulletins governing the conduct of those engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts. The findings and conclusions of the Report are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference. 	 A. Unfair or Deceptive Acts and Practices  (i). False and/or Misleading Representations of Prospective Borrowers' Income  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(8), effective as of September, 8, 2006, states: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker of mortgage lender to falsify income or asset information on a mortgage loan application or mortgage loan documents.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) states: 	 Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1) states, in part: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to make any representation or statement of fact if the representation or statement is false or misleading or has the tendency or capacity to be misleading.  Books and records reviewed during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that Castle Point falsified or misrepresented income information on mortgage loan documents relating to loans originated by the Corporation. Examples include, but are not limited to the following documents, as summarized below: 	 Loan #0005070736. 		 The initial stated income loan application prepared by Castle Point and completed as of July 18, 2005 for a loan which closed on September 1, 2005 indicated that the gross monthly base employment income of the applicant, a nurse, was $4,000, or $48,000 annually.  Correspondence addressed to a representative of Castle Point and dated July 25, 2005 from the applicant in the loan file indicates that the applicant's ""gross monthly earnings [as of the date of correspondence] are $3,200.00.""  The final application signed at closing reflects an increase in the applicant's reported gross monthly income to $5,000, or $60,000 annually.  On May 13, 2008, a representative of the applicant's employer advised the Division's examiners via telephone that the reported annual salary of $60,000 was overstated and added that the applicant's gross annual income, from the employer listed on the loan application, for 2005 was $2,737 and only $1,116.50 in 2006.  The discrepancy in income between the monthly earnings of $3,200 reported by the applicant and the annual salary of $60,000 reported on the loan application prepared by Castle Point, reveals that Castle Point overstated the applicant's gross annual income by approximately $21,600.  Loan #0005051008. 		 The initial stated income loan application prepared by Castle Point and completed as of May 10, 2005 for a loan which closed on July 22, 2005 indicated that the gross monthly base employment income of the applicant, a staff sergeant in the U.S. military, was $3,500, or $42,000 annually.  Two pay stubs contained in the loan file for the months of March 2005 and April 2005 reflect gross base monthly income of $2888.70, or $34,664.40 annually. Taking into account the housing, subsistence and cost of living allowances, which were itemized as additional income on the pay stubs, total gross monthly income is approximately $4,443.88, or $53,326.56 annually.  The final application signed at closing reflects an increase in the applicant's gross monthly income to $6,500, or $78,000 annually.  The discrepancy in income reveals that Castle Point overstated the applicant's gross annual income by approximately $24,673.44.  Upon inquiry, Castle Point's compliance manager explained that the gross monthly income included anticipated future earnings and rental income from the applicant's multi-family property. However, if accurate, the loan application prepared by Castle Point did not reflect the itemization of any rental income.  Loan #3000009448. 		 The initial full documentation loan application completed as of December 29, 2006 for a loan which closed on January 26, 2007 indicated that the gross monthly income of the applicant, the Director of Nursing at an assisted living facility, was $7,083, or $84,996 annually. This figure substantially corresponds with 2005 Form W-2s retained in the loan file.  The final application signed at closing reflects an increase in the applicant's gross monthly income to $10,766.36, or $129,196.32 annually.  The discrepancy in income reveals that Castle Point overstated the applicant's gross annual income by approximately $44,000.  (ii). Failure to Implement Appropriate Policies and Procedures Regarding Loans with Increased Risk and the Use of Reduced Documentation Mortgage Products  The Division's Regulatory Bulletin 5.1-103: Guidance on Non-Traditional Mortgage Products Risk, issued on January 8, 2007, states, in part: 	 As the level of credit risk increases, it is expected that a provider will more diligently verify and document a borrower's income and debt reduction capacity. Clear policies should govern the use of reduced documentation. For example, stated income should be accepted only if there are mitigating factors that clearly minimize the need for direct verification of repayment capacity. For many borrowers, providers generally should be able to readily document income using recent W-2 statements, pay stubs, or tax returns.  Loan #3000046450. 		 The final application for a stated income cash-out refinance, adjustable rate loan which closed on May 23, 2007 indicated that the gross monthly income of the applicant, an assistant groomer at a pet care and supply store, was $5,500, or $66,000 annually. The application indicated that the applicant had held the position of assistant groomer for only 5 months and had no previous relevant experience.  Information in the loan file indicates that the applicant's median FICO credit score reported was 496 with an anticipated debt-to-income (DTI) ratio of 53%, which would represent increased credit risk.  The Division's examiners could not locate any documentation in the loan file that would indicate the presence of mitigating factors that would minimize the need for verification of income and repayment capacity.  The Division's examiners could not locate any documentation in the loan file that would indicate that Castle Point had made an effort to document the borrower's income, which appeared to be overstated on its face.  Books and records reviewed during the 2008 examination/inspection indicate that approximately four months after the borrower obtained the May 2007 loan noted in subparagraph (a)  ii,  the borrower refinanced into a 30-year fixed rate full documentation loan.  In preparing the loan application under the full documentation loan program, Castle Point completed the loan application by reporting the annual income from the same employer and period referenced above in subparagraph (a)ii as $24,000, an amount which had been reported previously as $66,000.  Castle Point knew or should have known that the above referenced income and/or asset information as described in Paragraphs 15 and 16 would be relied upon by investors. 	 (iii). Signing Borrowers' Names on Mortgage Loan Documents without Authorization.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(7), effective as of September 8, 2006, states: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker or mortgage lender to sign a consumer's name to a mortgage loan application or mortgage loan documents on behalf of a consumer.  During the 2008 examination/inspection the Division's examiners identified at least three instances in which it appears that Castle Point reproduced the borrower's signatures on the ""Borrower's Signature Authorization"" forms, as specifically identified in the Report and incorporated herein by reference. Upon inquiry, each of the three borrowers confirmed that they had not signed the document in question and had not authorized Castle Point to sign their names on their behalf. 	 B. Undisclosed Fees  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 183, section 63 states, in part: 	 A mortgagee, or a mortgage lender or mortgage broker as defined in section one of chapter two hundred and fifty-five E, shall not charge a loan fee, finder's fee, points, so-called, or similar fees in a mortgage transaction involving residential property located in the commonwealth of four or less units and occupied in whole or in part by the mortgagor, except to the extent that such fees or points have been previously disclosed to the mortgagor in writing, which disclosure may be in the form required by section seventeen D of chapter one hundred and eighty-four, or such other form which discloses said fees or points. A mortgagor shall not be obligated to pay fees or points which have not been previously disclosed as required herein.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection indicate, as more fully described in the Report, that the Corporation engaged in a pattern or practice of understatements or omissions of the origination fees charged to consumers by Castle Point.  The 2008 examination/inspection revealed that origination fees were collected at the loan closing in amounts which Castle Point's books and records failed to document had been fully and accurately disclosed to consumers, in writing, to the extent charged at closing, if at all, as more fully described in the Report. 	 C. Failure to Provide Disclosures within Applicable Timing Requirements  Books and records reviewed during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that Castle Point's policies specify that all applicable preliminary disclosures be mailed from the Corporation's Maryland office on the third day after a full credit report is obtained, employment information and/or repayment capacity is supplied, an estimated and verbally verified home value is provided, and a loan amount is requested.  Applicable statutes and regulations setting forth the timing requirements in which certain preliminary disclosures must be provided to consumers include, but not limited to: the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.15 which requires the disclosure of license type and number at application; the Federal Trade Commission's regulation 16 CFR 313 which requires the provision of privacy policies in writing at application; the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) implementing regulations 24 CFR 3500.7(a), 3500.21(b), and 3500.15(b)(1) which require the provision of the good faith estimate, servicing disclosure statement, and affiliated business arrangement disclosure statement within three days of application; Section 609(g) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act which requires the provision of the credit score disclosure form at the time the credit report is produced; the Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.05(6) which required the provision of the Attorney General's Mortgage Lender Disclosure within three days of incurring an expense on behalf of the borrower; and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 32.19(2) which requires the provision of the Consumer Handbook on Adjustable Rate Mortgages and applicable adjustable rate program disclosures within three days of application.  Castle Point's policy, as set forth in Paragraph 23, does not allow for timely provision of disclosures for which timing requirements are triggered by the acceptance of an oral or written request for financing, initial submission of a written application, and/or incurrence of an expense on behalf of the applicant. 	 D. Deceptive Business Practices  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that Castle Point pre-dated certain documents presented at loan closings in an apparent attempt to avoid detection of violations of applicable federal and state consumer protection statutes and regulations governing the period in which the mortgage lender must provide such documents.  As specifically identified in the Report, certain disclosure forms contained computer-generated dates or stamped dates in the sections designated for the borrower to sign and date. In certain instances specifically identified in the Report, the disclosure forms were pre-dated prior to closing but were not provided for signature until the date of settlement, as evidenced by the fact that the borrower(s) crossed out the pre-printed date and inserted the actual date of settlement. 	 E. Determination of Borrower's Interest  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 183, section 28C(a) states, in part: 	 A lender shall not knowingly make a home loan if the home loan pays off all or part of an existing home loan that was consummated within the prior 60 months or other debt of the borrower, unless the refinancing is in the borrower's interest. The ""borrower's interest"" shall be narrowly construed, and the burden is upon the lender to determine that the refinancing is in the borrower's interest.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 53.07(1) states, in part: 	 A lender shall develop policies and procedures to demonstrate compliance with 209 CMR 53.00. Such policies and procedures shall include, at a minimum, a worksheet or other document to be dated at or before closing by the lender indicating how the lender determined that the home loan is in the borrower's interest...  A lender may request that a borrower acknowledge receipt of such a worksheet or other documentation; provided, however, a lender shall not shift the burden to the borrower to demonstrate that a home loan is in the borrower's interest.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that, in the majority of applicable files reviewed, the documentation that Castle Point provided to borrowers improperly shifted the burden to the borrowers to determine and document that the loan was in the borrowers' interest and to their benefit, as more specifically described in the Report. 	 F. Failure to Timely Provide Notification of Significant Events  The Division's Regulation 209 CMR 42.13(2) states: 	 Licensees shall provide thirty days prior written notice of any change or closing of a Massachusetts location to the Commissioner and shall contain such other information as the Commissioner may require.  Books and records reviewed during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that Castle Point failed to provide thirty days prior notice of the closing of the Corporation's Andover, Massachusetts office location. Specifically, Castle Point's notification of the closing of the office, received by the Division on January 24, 2008, stated that the branch had closed as of January 18, 2008.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12(3)(a) states, in part: 	 15 days prior to any proposed change in control in the ownership of a Licensee, or among the officers, partners or directors of a Licensee, a notice shall forthwith be filed with the Commissioner who may thereupon cause such investigation to be made as he deems necessary, as if it were a new license.  Books and records reviewed during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that Castle Point notified the Division on October 28, 2004 of a new Vice President and Treasurer, effective November 1, 2004. 	 G. Misleading Representations  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1) states, in part: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to make any representation or statement of fact if the representation or statement is false or misleading, or has the tendency or capacity to be misleading.  Books and records reviewed during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed numerous instances in which Castle Point provided documentation to consumers that contained false or misleading information. Examples are described in the Report and include, but are not limited to, the following: 	 The ""Lock-In/Financing Agreement"" form provided by Castle Point to all consumers states that Private Mortgage Insurance (""PMI"") is ""not required"" even in cases when PMI was required in connection with the loan obtained by the borrower. Moreover, the PMI was included in the principal and interest payment listed in the form.  Adjustable rate mortgage disclosures provided by Castle Point for loans closed in May 2007 referenced examples of loan terms based on the LIBOR index rate as of January 2005. (In addition, such disclosure is not in compliance with the Official Staff Interpretation, Regulation Z (Truth in Lending) section 226.19(b)(2)(5) which states: ""A creditor must revise the disclosures required under this section once a year as soon as reasonably possible after the new index value becomes available. Revisions to the disclosures also are required when the loan program changes."")  H. Inaccurate Loan Application Data Reported on Loan/Application Register  The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (""HMDA"") implementing regulation 12 CFR 203 (""Regulation C"") requires that financial institutions collect certain data regarding applications for, and originations and purchases of, home purchase loans, home improvement loans, and refinancings for each calendar year. All reportable information is required to be recorded on a loan/application register (""LAR"") in the format prescribed in Appendix A of Regulation C.  In order to assess compliance with the data recording requirements of Regulation C, the Division's examiner reviewed 25 residential mortgage applications for the 2006 calendar year and compared the information contained therein with the data recorded by Castle Point on the 2006 LAR.  The Division's examiner concluded that for 22 of the 25 applications reviewed, Castle Point inaccurately reported certain items on the 2006 LAR, including information reported in designated 'key columns,' as fully described in the Report and incorporated herein by reference. Furthermore, the examiner determined that Castle Point failed to record on the 2006 LAR two of the loan files contained in the sample reviewed.

CHARGE FIVE : By failing to provide certain disclosures within the relevant timing requirements, Castle Point has violated the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.15, the Federal Trade Commission's regulation 16 CFR 313, the RESPA implementing regulation 24 CFR 3500.7(a), 3500.21(b), and 3500.15(b)(1), Section 609(g) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.05(6), and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 32.19(2).  CHARGE SIX : By pre-dating certain documents presented at loan closings for the borrowers' signature in an apparent attempt to avoid detection of violations of applicable federal and state consumer protection statutes and regulations governing the period in which the mortgage lender must provide such documents, Castle Point has violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) and the Office of the Attorney General's implementing regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1).

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE BROKER  LICENSING  Docket No. 2009-002  FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  ABBOTT MORTGAGE CORPORATION  SEMYON KARASIK, individually  Woburn, Massachusetts  Mortgage Broker License No. MB0170  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that ABBOTT MORTGAGE CORPORATION and SEMYON KARASIK (collectively, ""Abbott Mortgage"" or the ""Corporation""), with its main business office located at 10 Tower Office Park, Woburn, Massachusetts, has engaged in, or is engaged in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""Temporary Order"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E section 7(b).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  At all relevant times, Abbott Mortgage was a corporation conducting business in the Commonwealth. At all relevant times, Abbott Mortgage's main office was located at 10 Tower Office Park, Woburn, Massachusetts.  At relevant times, Abbott Mortgage was licensed by the Division as a mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner issued mortgage broker license number MB0170 to Abbott Mortgage to engage in the business of a mortgage broker at 10 Tower Office Park, Woburn, Massachusetts on April 9, 1996.  Through license renewal applications filed with the Division, Abbott Mortgage maintained mortgage broker license number MB0170 through the period ending December 31, 2008.  At all relevant times, Semyon Karasik was President and 100% owner of Abbott Mortgage.  Mortgage brokers in Massachusetts are licensed and regulated under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, which is administered and enforced by the Commissioner. Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division is authorized to inspect the books, accounts, papers, records, and files of mortgage brokers transacting business in Massachusetts to determine compliance with the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E or any rule, or regulation issued thereunder, and with any law, rule, or regulation applicable to the conduct of the business of a mortgage broker.  Pursuant to the authority granted under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division commenced an examination/inspection of the books, accounts, papers, records, and files maintained by Abbott Mortgage on or about November 4, 2008 to evaluate the Corporation's compliance with the laws, regulations, and regulatory bulletins applicable to the conduct of a mortgage broker business in Massachusetts (the ""Examination/Inspection"").  The Division's Report of Examination/Inspection prepared as of November 4, 2008 (the ""Report""), which was issued to Abbott Mortgage on the effective date of this Temporary Order, presents the findings from the Examination/Inspection. As set forth in part below, the Report alleges significant failures to comply with applicable state and federal laws, rules, regulations, and regulatory bulletins governing the conduct of those engaged in the business of a mortgage broker in Massachusetts. The findings and conclusions of the Report are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference. 	 A. Deceptive Business Practices  Effective as of September 8, 2006, the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(7) states: 	 ""It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker or mortgage lender to sign a consumer's name to a mortgage loan application or mortgage loan documents on behalf of the consumer.""  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) states: 	 ""Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.""  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the Examination/Inspection revealed that loan documents including initial consumer disclosures, had been modified and/or altered by Abbott Mortgage. Specifically, the Division's examiners determined that Abbott Mortgage engaged in a pattern or practice of cutting borrowers' signatures from copies of original documents that were in the Corporation's files and affixing the copied signatures onto other loan documents prior to submitting said documents to a lender for funding. These loan documents include but are not limited to: Loan Origination and Compensation Agreement (""Agreement""), Borrower's Certification and Authorization Form (""Certification""), Automatic Loan Payment Authorization (""Authorization""), Biweekly Electronic Funds Transfer Authorization (""Biweekly Authorization""), Consent to Social Security Administration's Release of Social Security Number Verification Form (""Consent to the Social Security Administration"") and a Notice About Appraisal of Your Property Form (""Notice of Appraisal).  Examples of the practices referenced in the Paragraph above are cited in the Report and include, but are not limited to, the following loan files: Loan Nos. 4904598, 3060702879, 0045029543, and 2818040446. The examiners' specific findings are fully described in the Report and are incorporated herein by reference.  Effective as of September 8, 2006, the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(6) states: 	 ""It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker or mortgage lender to have a consumer sign a blank or incomplete mortgage loan application or mortgage loan documents.""  Books and records reviewed during the Examination/Inspection revealed instances in which Abbott Mortgage had applicants sign blank or incomplete initial disclosure forms, including but not limited to, Loan Origination and Compensation Agreements and an Attorney General's Mortgage Broker Disclosure. Examples of the practice referenced in this Paragraph include, but are not limited to, the following loan files: Loan Nos. 07005319946 and AMC4033-07-2Q. 	 B. Failure to Properly Maintain Books and Records  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.09(1)(b) states in part: 	 ""Each Licensee shall keep and use its books, records and accounts in a manner which will allow the Commissioner to determine whether the Licensee is complying with the provisions of M.G.L. c. 255E and applicable state and federal laws and regulations. Each Licensee shall comply with the provisions of 209 CMR 48.00. The following records shall be maintainedÃ¢â'¬Â¦(b) each mortgage broker required Ã¢â'¬Â¦shall retain for a minimum of three years after a mortgage loan is made the following: the original loan origination and compensation agreement as set out in 209 CMR 42.16; a copy of the settlement statement; an account of fees received in connection with the loan; correspondence; papers or records relating to the loan; and such other documents as the Commissioner may require.""  The Examination/Inspection revealed that, in an apparent attempt to recycle paper documents by using the blank side of original loan-related documents for printer/photocopy paper, Abbott Mortgage failed to retain all documents relating to the loan transaction in the appropriate loan files. Moreover, in numerous instances, this practice resulted in the placement of certain applicants' personal loan information, including social security numbers and other sensitive information, in the loan files of other unrelated applicants. 	 C. Mortgage Broker Acting as a Mortgage Lender & Diminishing Protection of Borrower's Interest Regulation  General Laws chapter 183, section 28(c)(a) states in part: 	 ""A lender shall not knowingly make a home loan if the home loan pays off all or part of an existing home loan Ã¢â'¬Â¦unless the refinancing is in the borrower's interest. The ""borrower's interest"" standard shall be narrowly construed, and the burden is upon the lender to determine and to demonstrate that the refinancing is in the borrower's interest.""  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 53.07(1)(b) states in part: 	 ""A lender may request that a borrower acknowledge receipt of such a worksheet or other documentation; provided, however, a lender shall not shift the burden to the borrower to demonstrate that a home loan is in the borrower's interest; and provided further that a lender shall not require a borrower to sign a waiver of future claims under G.L. c. 183, s. 28C or 209 CMR 53.00.""  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the Examination/Inspection revealed that Abbott Mortgage provided applicants with a document entitled, ""Massachusetts Compliance Worksheet on Borrower's Interest"" (""Worksheet""), a document that only mortgage lenders are authorized to provide to borrowers.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the Examination/Inspection also revealed that the language used in the Worksheet provided to the applicable consumers was not in compliance with 209 CMR 53.07(1)(b) inasmuch as it shifted the burden to the borrowers to demonstrate that the loan was in the their interest and to their benefit. 	 D. Failure to Provide Required Disclosures  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(12) states: 	 ""It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker or mortgage lender to engage in a pattern or practice of failing to make any disclosure to a consumer required by and at the time specified by any applicable state or federal law, regulation or directive.""  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the Examination/Inspection revealed that Abbott Mortgage consistently failed to retain evidence of having provided applicants with the credit score disclosure required under Section 609(g) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 [15 U.S.C. Ã'Â§ 1681g(g)]. This practice was observed in all loan files reviewed during the Examination/Inspection. 	 E. Engaging in Prohibited Advertising Practices  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.04(1) states in part: 	 ""It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to make any representation or statement of fact in an advertisement if the representation or statement is false or misleading or has the tendency or capacity to be misleading.""  Abbott Mortgage identified itself as a ""Lender"" on several advertisements and flyers forwarded to consumers throughout the Commonwealth. A newsletter mailed by Abbott mortgage contained a section under the heading ""Ask the Underwriter."" The Corporation's website indicated that some of the services provided by Abbott Mortgage included ""pre-approval before you start shopping for a house."" The language cited in this Paragraph has the tendency or capacity to mislead consumers by presenting the appearance that Abbott Mortgage, a mortgage broker, is approving or funding loans.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(4) states: 	 ""It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker to advertise any interest rate or loan term described in 209 CMR 32.24(3)(a) in any media without the following statement: ""We arrange but do not make loans"". No advertisement by a mortgage broker in any media shall contain language which indicates or suggests that the mortgage broker will fund or approve a mortgage loan or guarantee any rate.""  Abbott Mortgage's website advertised interest rates and/or loan terms without including the statement, ""We arrange but do not make loans.""  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.04(4)(d) states: 	 ""(4) It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to engage in bait advertising or to misrepresent (directly or by failure to adequately disclose) the terms, conditions or charges incident to the mortgage loan being advertised in any advertisement. Violation of 940 CMR 8.04(4) shall include, but not be limited to:  (d) the advertisement through terms such as ""bad credit no problem"" or words of similar import or that an applicant will have unqualified access to credit without clearly and conspicuously disclosing the material limitations on the availability of credit that may exist, such as:  requirements for the availability of credit (such as income);  that a higher rate or more points may be required for a consumer with bad credit; and  that restrictions as to the maximum principal amount of the loan offered may apply.""  A consumer solicitation issued by Abbott Mortgage contains the phrase ""Bankruptcy Discharged 1 day . . . OK!"", presenting the appearance that applicants will have unqualified access to credit and does not include the disclosure language required pursuant to 940 CMR 8.04(4)(d).  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 32.24(3)(b) states: 	 ""An advertisement stating any of the terms in 209 CMR 32.24(3)(a) [e.g. amount and/or number of payments] shall state the following terms, as applicable:  The amount or percentage of the downpayment.  The terms of repayment.  The ""annual percentage rate"", using that term, and, if the rate may be increased after consummation, that fact.""  Abbott Mortgage's website set forth the amount and number of payments but failed to include the additional disclosures required pursuant to 209 CMR 32.24(3)(b). 	 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 30, Semyon Karasik and Abbott Mortgage have failed to demonstrate and maintain the character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the mortgage broker business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 30, by modifying and altering loan documents prepared on behalf of consumers and submitted to mortgage lenders for funding, Abbott Mortgage has engaged in unfair and deceptive business practices in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 30, by cutting and pasting consumers signatures to mortgage loan documents, Abbott Mortgage has violated the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(7).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 30, by having consumer's sign blank loan documents, Abbott Mortgage has violated the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(6).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 30, by recycling the reverse of certain loan documents to use for photocopying and printing, Abbott Mortgage has failed to properly maintain books and records in violation of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.09(1).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 30, by providing mortgage loan applicants with disclosures that only mortgage lenders are authorized to provide, Abbott Mortgage has acted as a mortgage lender without holding a mortgage lender license, in violation of Massachusetts General Laws, chapter 255E, section 2.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 30, by disseminating consumer solicitations that contained false or misleading language or had the tendency to be false or misleading, Abbott Mortgage has violated the Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.04(1).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 30, by advertising interest rates and/or loan terms on the Corporation's website without including the statement, ""We arrange but do not make loans,"" Abbott Mortgage has violated the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(4).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 30, by engaging in so-called ""bait advertising"" and failing to include required disclosure language on consumer solicitations, Abbott Mortgage has violated the Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.04(4).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 35, by failing to include required language on the Corporation's website when advertising certain credit terms, Abbott Mortgage has violated the Division's regulations 209 32.24(3).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 30, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 (a) Abbott Mortgage has engaged in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that the Corporation is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage broker including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00 et seq.  (b)The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to Semyon Karasik and Abbott Mortgage.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 30, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of Abbott Mortgage's original mortgage broker license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 30 present sufficient grounds for the revocation of Abbott Mortgage's mortgage broker license pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.07(2)(b), and 42.12A(19). 	 ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that Semyon Karasik, Abbott Mortgage, its officers, directors, employees, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of a mortgage broker, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1 relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Temporary Order.

Abbott Mortgage shall obtain the prior approval of the Commissioner before placing such applications to the qualified broker(s) or lender(s).  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Abbott Mortgage shall submit to the Commissioner a detailed record, prepared as of the date of submission, of all the Corporation's pending residential mortgage loan applications on property located in Massachusetts.

The FDIC and the Division considered the matter and determined that they had reason to believe that the Bank engaged in unsafe or unsound banking practices and violations of law and/or regulations. The FDIC and the Division, therefore, accepted the CONSENT AGREEMENT and issued the following:  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Bank, its institutionaffiliated parties, as that term is defined in section 3(u) of the Act, 12 U.S.C. § 1813(u), and its successors and assigns, cease and desist from the following unsafe or unsound banking practices and violations of law and/or regulations:  Operating with an inadequate level of capital for the kind and quality of assets held;  Operating with an excessive volume of criticized assets;  Operating with inadequate management, policies and practices;  Failing to provide for an effective system to identify problem assets and prevent deterioration; and  Operating with deficient earnings.

The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1) states, in part: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to make any representation or statement of fact if the representation or statement is false or misleading or has the tendency or capacity to be misleading.  In defining a principal dwelling in the commentary to section 226.2(a)(24) of the Federal Reserve Board's Official Staff Commentary on Regulation Z, the Commentary states in part, ""A consumer can only have one principal dwelling at a time.""  The Division's 2008 examination/inspection revealed that Nationwide Equities concealed and/or misrepresented information relating to the occupancy status of multiple properties for which Nationwide Equities sought residential mortgage loans on behalf of Massachusetts applicants. Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners revealed that Nationwide Equities, in multiple transactions in which it acted in the capacity of a mortgage broker, prepared and submitted, simultaneously, purchase money mortgage loan applications for multiple properties on behalf of an individual borrower, with each application indicating that the subject property was to be used as the borrower's primary residence. Examples include but are not limited to the following: 	 Loans ""A"", ""B"", ""C"" and ""D"": 		 Four purchase money loan applications, prepared on September 24, 2007 by Nationwide Equities on behalf of an individual applicant indicated that the applicant was to purchase four condominium units each of which were part of one condominium project. Each purchase money loan application indicated that the condominium unit was to be the applicant's primary residence.  Each purchase money loan application was submitted to the lenders and the settlement dates reflected on the HUD settlement statement for three of the four loans was on October 30, 2007. The settlement date for the fourth unit was listed as October 31, 2007.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners further revealed that the branch manager of Nationwide Equities' Dorchester location was specifically prohibited by the lender in the transaction described above from adding his name to the title of at least one of the four units. A review of e-mail correspondence sent from the lender to the Nationwide Equities branch manager revealed that a representative of the lender had e-mailed the Nationwide Equities branch manager correspondence that stated, in part, that, ""you will not be able to add your name to title."" However, a subsequent review of registry records revealed that a deed transferring title from the borrower to both the borrower and the Nationwide Equities branch manager was recorded immediately after the recording of the mortgage deed reflecting only the borrower as the title holder. During a discussion with a representative of the lender, the Division's examiners were informed that the loan would not have closed had the lender been aware that the Nationwide Equities branch manager's name was to be included on property title. 	 (b) Loan No.(s): 1764663230; 3015412384; and 9999080365:  A review of these three loan files each originated on behalf of one borrower by Nationwide Equities revealed that, three purchase money loan applications were taken on behalf of one borrower for three separate properties on the same date. A review of the loan applications, submitted to three lenders, indicated that each subject property was to be the borrower's primary residence.  A review of two of the three loan files revealed that the borrower purchased two condominium units each of which was part of one condominium project. Each purchase money loan application indicated that the unit was to be the borrower's primary residence.  The settlement dates of the three loans were on February 1, 2008, February 5, 2008, and April 14, 2008, respectively.  The examiners' detailed findings relating to these loans are more fully described in the Report and are incorporated herein by reference. 	 (2.) Misrepresentation of a Prospective Borrower's Income, Asset and Employment Information  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(8), effective as of September, 8, 2006, states: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker of mortgage lender to falsify income or asset information on a mortgage loan application or mortgage loan documents.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) states: 	 Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1) states, in part: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to make any representation or statement of fact if the representation or statement is false or misleading or has the tendency or capacity to be misleading.  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.06(15) states, in part 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker to arrange or mortgage lender to make a mortgage loan unless the mortgage broker or lender, based on information known at the time the loan is made, reasonably believes at the time the loan is expected to be made that the borrower will be able to repay the loan based upon a consideration of the borrower's income, assets, obligations, employment status, credit history, and financial resources, not limited to the borrower's equity in the dwelling which secures repayment of the loan.  On September 4, 2008, during an interview with the branch manager of Nationwide Equities Dorchester location, the Division's examiners were informed by the branch manager that it was common practice for Nationwide Equities to: 	 [C]onsider multiple incomes of non-borrower individuals living in a household in order to qualify applicant(s) for a loan program that the borrower(s) would not otherwise qualify for due to insufficient or low income levels. Aggregated income [would be] reflected on the Form 1003, as [the] base income of the applicant(s). [The branch manager] cited as an example a bus/train operator whose salary level may not qualify him/her for a particular loan program. In order to get approval for the loan application, [the Branch Manager] would first check with salary.com for a maximum salary payable to that position. Based on this information, [the branch manager would] then formulate the household income of the people living with the applicant(s) to meet the lenders' income level requirement. The loan application [would] then [be] processed based on this information.  Taken as true, the description provided above by the branch manager of the Dorchester, Massachusetts location of the practices and procedures engaged in on behalf of Nationwide Equities appears to constitute an admission by the branch manager that Nationwide Equities engaged in the act or practice of falsifying and/or misrepresenting income information on mortgage loan application(s) in order to qualify the applicant(s) for a loan amount which the applicant(s) did not have the ability to repay.  Books and records reviewed during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that Nationwide Equities, when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker, had completed and submitted to lenders several Uniform Residential Loan Applications (""1003 Form"") in which the applicants' financial and employment information, including but not limited to, applicants' base employment income, assets, liability and the total number of years an applicant had been employed, differed significantly from the financial and employment information reflected on other pertinent documentation, including, but not limited to loan applications completed concurrently on behalf of the same borrower by Nationwide Equities for loan applications submitted to separate lenders. Examples include, but are not limited to, the following: 	 Loan No.(s): 9999080365; 3015412384; and 1764663230: 		 A purchase money loan application prepared by Nationwide Equities on January 6, 2008 for a loan that ultimately closed on February 1, 2008, indicated that the applicant earned approximately $6,200 monthly or $74,400 annually. The loan application reflected the applicant's total liquid assets as $480,103. (Loan number: 9999080365);  A purchase money loan application also prepared by Nationwide Equities on January 6, 2008 for a loan ultimately closed on February 5, 2008, indicated that the same applicant earned approximately $4,615.38 monthly or $55,384.56 annually. The loan application now reported the applicant's total liquid assets, on the same date, as $453,408. (Loan number: 3015412384);  A purchase money loan application also prepared by Nationwide Equities on January 6, 2008 for a loan that ultimately closed on April 14, 2008, indicated that the same applicant earned approximately $5,230.77 monthly or $62,769.24 annually. The loan application now reported the same applicant's total liquid assets as $520,652. (Loan number: 1764663230).  Loan No.(s): 3013911841-031; and 0762046340: 		 A first mortgage loan application prepared by Nationwide Equities for a loan that ultimately closed on June 29, 2007, indicated that the applicant had been employed with one company for 20 years and that the applicant had a credit card balance for one account in the amount of $2,000;  A simultaneous second mortgage loan application prepared by Nationwide Equities for a loan ultimately closed on the same date on June 29, 2007 indicated that the same applicant had been employed with one company for 5 years, and that the applicant's credit card balance for the same account reflected on the first mortgage loan application was now reported in the amount of $8,958;  A review of the of the first mortgage loan application retained in the loan file maintained by Nationwide Equities revealed that the years of employment had been manipulated from 10 years to 20 years.  Nationwide Equities knew or should have known that the above referenced income, asset, and employment information would be relied upon in underwriting the mortgage loan by the mortgage lender or financial institution to which the mortgage loan applications were brokered by Nationwide Equities. 	 B. Engaging in the Mortgage Lender and Mortgage Broker Business in Massachusetts from Unlicensed Locations  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2 states in part: 	 No person shall act as a mortgage broker or mortgage lender with respect to residential property unless first obtaining a license from the commissioner; provided, however, that any person who is employed by or associated with a licensed mortgage broker or mortgage lender in the capacity of a mortgage broker or mortgage lender under the direction of said licensed mortgage broker or mortgage lender shall not be required to obtain such license.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection indicate that, beginning on a date that is unknown to the Division and continuing at least until the date of the 2008 examination/inspection, Nationwide Equities conducted its mortgage lender and mortgage broker business at two office locations, for which Nationwide Equities failed to provide prior notice to the Commissioner, submit a license application, or receive approval from the Commissioner to engage in the mortgage lender and mortgage broker business from such locations.  Nationwide Equities conducted the mortgage lender and mortgage broker business at two locations in Everett, Massachusetts and Trenton, New Jersey, respectively, beginning on a date that is unknown to the Division, but continuing at least until the date of the 2008 examination/inspection..  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection further indicate that, from approximately November, 5, 2005, and continuing at least until the date of the 2008 examination/inspection, Nationwide Equities conducted its mortgage lender and mortgage broker business at an office located at 1972 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, Massachusetts (""Cambridge location"").  The Division's records indicate that although Nationwide Equities had previously held a mortgage broker license for the Cambridge location from June 4, 2004 until surrendering the license prior to its expiration on May 31, 2005, the branch license for such location was not maintained for the period beginning November 5, 2005 referenced above. 	 C. Failure to Maintain Required Surety Bonds  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.03(2)(a)2 requires all licensed mortgage lenders to maintain a surety bond of no less than $100,000 to a maximum of $500,000 as determined by the Commissioner by December 31, 2008.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.03(2)(a)2 states in part: 	 (a). An Applicant shall demonstrate and maintain (2) a bond in a sum to be based on the amount of the Applicant's aggregate mortgage loans, as determined by the Commissioner, but in no event shall the sum of the bond be less than $100,000, up to a maximum of $500,000.  Based upon information and belief, Nationwide Equities failed to meet the aforementioned requirement as of the date of this Temporary Order.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.06(2)(a)2 requires all licensed mortgage brokers to maintain a surety bond of no less than $75,000 by December 31, 2008.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.06 (2)(a)2 states in part: 	 (a). An Applicant shall demonstrate and maintain (2) a bond of $75,000 in such form and with such sureties as may be approved by the Commissioner.  Based upon information and belief, Nationwide Equities failed to meet the aforementioned requirement as of the date of this Temporary Order. 	 D. Conducting Business Under an Unlicensed Name  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 5 states: 	 Each license shall state the address at which the business is to be conducted and shall state the name of the licensee. If a licensee intends to carry on such business at any place in addition to the address on the license, he shall so notify the commissioner, in writing, at least 30 days prior thereto... Such notice shall contain the address of any such additional location and such other information as the commissioner may require; provided, however, that any such business shall at all times be conducted in the name of the licensee as it appears on the license.  The Division's records indicate that Nationwide Equities is currently licensed as Nationwide Equities Corporation.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that Nationwide Equities provided at least one borrower correspondence that indicated that the licensed business was being conducted by Magee Mortgage Group, LLC. Specifically, records reviewed by the Division's examiners indicate that the one borrower was issued a letter of confirmation by Magee Mortgage Group, LLC. 	 E. Failure to Properly Maintain Books and Records  (1.) Failure to Maintain Adequate Records  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8 states in part: 	 A licensee shall keep and use such business records in such form and at such location as said commissioner shall, by regulation, determine, which shall enable said commissioner to determine whether such licensee is complying with the provisions of this chapter and any rules or regulations promulgated hereunder by said commissioner and any other law, rule or regulation applicable to the conduct of the business for which it is licensed under this chapter.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that Nationwide Equities provided several loan lists to the Division's examiners during the course of the 2008 examination/inspection that reflected conflicting information. Specifically, the Division's examiners were provided with at least three loan lists by the Corporation, that each reflected varying numbers of loans originated by Nationwide Equities. In addition, the Division's examiners determined that the information reflected on the loan lists provided by Nationwide Equities for 2006 was contradictory to an annual report filed previously by Nationwide Equities with the Division.  A review of the 2006 annual report filed by Nationwide Equities indicated that the Corporation had originated 49 loans. However, loan lists provided by the Corporation to the Division's examiners on August 11, 2008 and August 12, 2008 indicated that Nationwide Equities had originated 12 and 16 loans respectively. A review of Nationwide Equities' electronic database revealed that only 15 loan files were available for review.  On September 15, 2008 in response to a 72-hour Demand Notice issued by the Division ordering the production of selected books and records, Nationwide Equities provided a loan list that reflected 49 originations, however Nationwide Equities failed to provide all of the 49 loan files to the Division's examiners for review. 	 (2.) Failure to File Required Reports in a Timely Manner  The Division regulation 209 CMR 42.09(4) states: 	 In addition to the reports required by law, a Licensee shall make such other statements and reports to the Commissioner as he or she may require from time to time. The Commissioner may require regular quarterly reports and may furnish blank forms for all such statements or reports, required by 209 CMR 42.09.  A review of the reports filed by Nationwide Equities revealed that the Corporation consistently failed to file the Corporation's quarterly reports in a timely fashion. Specifically, Nationwide Equities filed the quarterly reports for quarters ending September 30, 2007, June 30, 2008 and March 30, 2008 on August 21, 2008 subsequent to the Division's request. 	 (3.) Failure to Maintain Books and Records in a Manner to Demonstrate Compliance  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.09(1) states: 	 Each Licensee shall keep and use its books, records and accounts in a manner which will allow the Commissioner to determine whether the Licensee is complying with the provisions of M.G.L. c. 255E and applicable state and federal laws and regulations. Each Licensee shall comply with the provisions of 209 CMR 48.00...(b) The mortgage broker ... shall retain for a minimum of three years after a mortgage loan is made the following: the original loan origination and compensation agreement as set out in 209 CMR 42.16; a copy of the settlement statement; an account of fees received in connection with the loan; correspondence; papers or records relating to the loan; and such other documents as the Commissioner may require.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection indicated that Nationwide Equities, when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker, failed to retain sufficient documentation to enable the Division's examiners to determine whether the Corporation was complying with certain laws and regulations governing mortgage brokers in Massachusetts. Specifically, a review of several full documentation loan files revealed that Nationwide Equities failed to retain sufficient documents necessary to ensure the validity of income and asset information reflected on the loan applications submitted to mortgage lenders for approval. 	 F. Loan Origination and Compensation Agreement  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(5) states in part: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker to fail to provide to the consumer at the time of application the loan origination and compensation agreement required under 209 CMR 42.16. The content of the agreement shall strictly conform to 209 CMR 42.16 and include signatures and dates by the consumer(s) and the mortgage broker.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.09(1)(b) states, in part: 	 Each mortgage broker . . . shall retain for a minimum of three years after a mortgage loan is made the following: the original loan origination and compensation agreement as set out in 209 CMR 42.16.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that Nationwide Equities when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker, failed to retain evidence of having provided the Loan Origination and Compensation Agreements in all files reviewed. 	 G. Providing Mortgage Lender Disclosures to Consumers When Acting in the Capacity of a Mortgage Broker  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection indicate that Nationwide Equities, when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker, routinely provided several mortgage lender disclosures to consumers. The mortgage lender disclosures include, but are not limited to, Equal Credit Opportunity Notices, Affidavit of Occupancy Notices and Approval Letters. 	 H. Engaging in Prohibited Advertising Practices  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.15 states in part: 	 A Licensee shall disclose the type and number of its license(s) in all advertisements.  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.04(2) states, in part: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to advertise without clearly and conspicuously disclosing its business name, the words ""broker"" or ""lender"", as applicable, and the license number.  A review of Nationwide Equities website revealed that Corporation failed to disclose its license type and number as required pursuant to the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.15 and the Attorney General's regulation at 940 CMR 8.04(2). 	 I. Failure to Provide Required Notices  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 167, section 14A states: 	 Any applicant whose residential mortgage loan application is denied by any mortgagee making five or more mortgage loans in any calendar year on residential property located in the commonwealth of four units or less and occupied in whole or in part by the mortgagor shall be instructed by the mortgagee, in writing, at the time of denial of his right to appeal any such denial to the appropriate mortgage review board.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(12) states: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker or mortgage lender to engage in a pattern or practice of failing to make any disclosure to a consumer required by and at the time specified by any applicable state or federal law, regulation or directive.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners revealed that Nationwide Equities when acting in the capacity of a mortgage lender, failed to retain evidence of having provided the Mortgage Review Board Notice in at least ten loan files reviewed. 	 J. Misleading Statements  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1) states, in part: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to make any representation or statement of fact if the representation or statement is false or misleading, or has the tendency or capacity to be misleading.  Books and records reviewed during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that Nationwide Equities, when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker, provided applicants with a Borrower's Certification and Authorization Form that contained language that was false or misleading or had the tendency or capacity to be false or misleading. Specifically, the Borrower's Certification and Authorization Form contained language which suggests that Nationwide Equities, while acting as the mortgage broker in the transaction, was approving or funding the mortgage loan which, if true, would exceed the authority of the mortgage broker in the transaction. 	 K. Failure to Properly Complete Good Faith Estimates  The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (""RESPA"") regulation 24 CMR 3500.7, Appendix B section 13 states, in part: 	 Any . . .fee or payment received by the mortgage broker from either the lender or the borrower arising from the initial funding transaction, including a servicing release premium or yield spread premium, is to be noted on the Good Faith Estimate and listed in the 800 series of the HUD-1 Settlement Statement.  Books and records reviewed during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that, in all loan files reviewed, Nationwide Equities failed to disclose the yield spread premium in a dollar amount or dollar range on the good faith estimate provided to the borrower(s), as specifically identified in the Report. 	 L. Other Violations  In addition to the violations specifically set forth in this Temporary Order, a Report of Examination/Inspection on Consumer Compliance prepared as of July 22, 2008 and to be provided to Nationwide Equities in conjunction with the issuance of this Temporary Order, describes other violations and areas of concern observed during the 2008 examination/inspection. 	 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 58, Nationwide Equities has failed to demonstrate and maintain the character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the mortgage lender and mortgage broker business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulations 209 CMR 42.03(2)(c) and 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).

Agreement provided to consumers when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker, Nationwide Equities has violated the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(5) and 209 CMR 42.09(1)(b).

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  DEBT COLLECTOR LICENSING  Docket No. 2009-013  FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  WALKER ASSOCIATES, INC.  Boston, Massachusetts  Debt Collector License No. DC0002  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that WALKER ASSOCIATES INC., located at 2 Oliver Street, 3  rd  floor, Boston, Massachusetts, and (""Walker Associates"" or the ""Corporation""), has engaged, or is engaged in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93, sections 24 through 28, inclusive, and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 18.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""TEMPORARY ORDER"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 93, section 24J.  A. FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a debt collector in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93, section 24A.  At all relevant times, Walker Associates was a corporation conducting business in the Commonwealth. Walker Associates is licensed by the Commissioner as a debt collector as required by Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93, section 24A. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner issued Walker Associates' initial license to engage in the business of a collection agency at 2 Oliver Street, 3  rd  Floor, Boston, Massachusetts on September 29, 1986 with original license number CA0002. In 2004, pursuant to statutory and regulation changes affecting the licensing of debt collectors in Massachusetts, the Division changed Walker Associates' license number to DC0002.  According to the Division's records, Stephen P. Colahan is the president and a forty percent (40%) shareholder of Walker Associates.  On May 5, 2009, a Grand Jury, impaneled in the Suffolk County Superior Court, Suffolk County, Massachusetts, returned an indictment against Mr. Colahan charging him with three felony counts including: one count of larceny over $250 by single scheme in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 266, section 30 and with two counts of procurement fraud in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 266, section 67A.  	  	 (i) Felony Indictments Affecting a Determination of the Licensee's Financial Responsibility, Character, Reputation, Integrity and General Fitness to Engage in the Licensed Business  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93, section 24I(a) states: 	 (a)The commissioner may suspend or revoke a license issued pursuant to this chapter if the commissioner finds that: (1) the licensee has violated this chapter or any rule or regulation adopted hereunder, or any other law applicable to the conduct of its business; or (2) any fact or condition exists which, if it had existed at the time of the original application for the license, would have warranted the commissioner in refusing to issue the license.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93 section 24B states, in part: 	 The commissioner may reject an application for a [debt collector] license or an application for the renewal of a license if he is not satisfied that the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity and general fitness of the applicant and of the owners, partners or members thereof, if the applicant be a partnership or association, and of the officers and directors, if the applicant be a corporation, are such as to command the confidence of the public and to warrant the belief that the business for which the application for a license is filed will be operated lawfully, honestly and fairly.  The Commonwealth's Statement of the Case issued by the Massachusetts Attorney General's office, alleged that for approximately five years, while Walker Associates was under contract with the City of Boston to collect delinquent taxes, Mr. Colahan as president of Walker Associates took money out of the bank account into which Walker Associates deposited all of the City of Boston's collections, and used that money to cover Walker's business expenses. The Statement of the Case alleged that over the five year period, Mr. Colahan transferred over $2.7 million to Walker Associates' account.  	  	 (ii) Failure to Notify the Division of the Occurrence of Significant Developments  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 18.08(1)(b) states, in part: 	 (1) A debt collector . . . shall notify the Commissioner immediately, and in writing within one business day, of the occurrence of any of the following significant developments: (b) [t]he filing of a criminal indictment any way related to the activities of the debt collector or registered third party loan servicer, any partner, member, officer, director, or equivalent, or principal employee, including, but not limited to, the handling and/or reporting of moneys received and/or instruments sold.  As of the effective date of this Temporary Order, the Division has not received notification from Walker Associates of the occurrence of the events referenced above in Paragraphs 4 and 7 of this Temporary Order.  	  	 (iii) Failure to Maintain a Surety Bond  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93, section 24A(a) states: 	 (a) No person shall directly or indirectly engage in the commonwealth in the business of a debt collector, or engage in the commonwealth in soliciting the right to collect or receive payment for another of an account, bill or other indebtedness, or advertise for or solicit in print the right to collect or receive payment for another of an account, bill or other indebtedness, without first obtaining from the commissioner a license to carry on the business, nor unless the person or the person for whom he or it may be acting as agent has on file with the state treasurer a good and sufficient bond.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93 section 28 states: 	 Whoever fails to comply with any provision of this section or sections twenty-four to twenty-seven, inclusive, or any regulation promulgated in accordance with the provisions of section twenty-four, shall be punished by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars or by imprisonment for not more than three months, or both.  Failure to comply with any provision of this section or of section twenty-four to twenty-seven, inclusive, or any regulation promulgated in accordance with the provisions of section twenty-four shall constitute an unfair or deceptive act or practice under the provisions of paragraph (a) of section two of chapter ninety-three A.  On May 12, 2009, the Division received a Massachusetts Statutory Bond Cancellation (""Cancellation"") from the surety company which Walker Associates had maintained its surety bond. The Cancellation indicated that the cancellation would be effective as of June 14, 2009. 	 B. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 1 through 12, Walker Associates, has failed to demonstrate the character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93, sections 24B(a) and 24G(a), and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 18.03(2)(c).  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 1 through 12, Walker Associates failed to notify the Commissioner in writing, within one business day, that Mr. Colahan an officer and shareholder of the Corporation, had been indicted of a felony, in violation of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 18.08(1)(b).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 12, Walker Associates has failed to maintain a good and sufficient bond in violation of the Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93, section 24A(a).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 12, had the foregoing existed at the time of Walker Associates' original debt collector application, such conditions would have warranted a denial by the Commissioner of the license application and are grounds for the suspension or revocation of Walker Associates' debt collector license number DC0002, pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93, section 24I.  Based upon the information contained in paragraphs 1 through 12, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 Walker Associates has engaged, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that the Corporation is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a collection agency including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 18.00  et seq.  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to Walker Associates.  C. ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that Walker Associates and any and all employees, independent contractors, or agents operating on behalf of Walker Associates, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of a debt collector in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93, section 24, except as otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this TEMPORARY ORDER. Therefore, Walker Associates is ordered to immediately cease collecting any consumer collection accounts from debtors located within Massachusetts and to cease soliciting the right to collect or receive payment for another of an account, bill or other indebtedness, or advertise for or solicit in print the right to collect or receive payment for another of an account, bill or other indebtedness soliciting or accepting, either directly or indirectly, any third party debt collection accounts for any debtors located within Massachusetts.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Walker Associates, shall not dispose of any of the Corporation's assets located in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts without the prior written approval of the Commissioner.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Walker Associates shall, within ten (10) days of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, provide the Division with a complete record, including a verification of receipt, of all funds collected on behalf of clients from December 31, 2008 through the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Walker Associates shall, within ten (10) days of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, provide the Division with a record of all clients and/or creditors and a detailed record of all accounts held for collection by Walker Associates on behalf of such clients.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under General Laws chapter 30A.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such TEMPORARY ORDER shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from the Corporation within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER. If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this TEMPORARY ORDER shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.     BY ORDER AND DIRECTION OF THE COMMISSIONER OF BANKS.

90,5/21/2021,2009,Cease and Desist,Ramos Neighborhood Market,Check Casher,Failure to post required bond,Aliso Viejo CA,https://www.mass.gov/cease-order/ramos-neighborhood-market," COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  Suffolk, SS.  COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  CHECK CASHER LICENSING  Docket No. 2009-014  FINDINGS OF FACT AND  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  NIKKI NGUYEN a/k/a NIKKI H. BUI,  TRACY BUI AND RAMOS NEIGHBORHOOD MARKET, LLC  Worcester, Massachusetts     The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that NIKKI NGUYEN a/k/a NIKKI H. BUI, TRACY BUI and RAMOS NEIGHBORHOOD MARKET, LLC located at 6A Boylston Street, Worcester, Massachusetts have engaged, or are engaged in, or are about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169A and its implementing regulations at 209 CMR 45.00  et seq.,  hereby issues the following ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST pursuant to chapter 169A.  FINDINGS OF FACT  A. Unlicensed Check Cashing Activity  The Division of Banks (the ""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a check casher in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws 169A.  Nikki Nguyen a/k/a Nikki H. Bui and Tracy Bui individually and collectively, are the owners/officers of Ramos Neighborhood Market, LLC (""Ramos Market"" or the ""Corporation""), located at 6A Boylston Street, Worcester, Massachusetts.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169A, section 2 relative to the licensing requirements for entities engaged in the business of check cashing states: 	 No person or entity shall engage in cashing checks, drafts or money orders for a consideration in excess of one dollar per item without first obtaining a license from the commissioner...The commissioner shall establish rules and regulations, which may include an adequate capitalization requirement, for each place of business or mobile unit of a licensee to aid in the administration and enforcement of this chapter.     Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169A, section 13 states: 	 Whoever violates any provision of section two or any rule or regulation made thereunder by the commissioner shall be punished by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars or by imprisonment for not more than six months, or both. Each day a violation continues shall be deemed a separate offense.     On May 4, 2009, during an examination/inspection of an entity licensed as a check casher with the Division, the Division's examiners became aware that Nikki Nguyen a/k/a Nikki H. Bui, Tracy Bui and Ramos Market appeared to be engaging in unlicensed check cashing activity at 6A Boylston Street, Worcester, Massachusetts (""Worcester location"").  Based upon a review of the information obtained during the examination/inspection referenced in the Paragraph 5 of this Temporary Order, the Division's examiners conducted a visitation of the Worcester location (""Visitation"") on May 5, 2009 to confirm that Nikki Nguyen a/k/a Nikki H. Bui, Tracy Bui and Ramos Market were engaging in cashing checking activity, from the Worcester location.  On May 5, 2009, the Division's examiners determined during the Visitation and interviews conducted with Nikki Nguyen a/k/a Nikki H. Bui via teleconference and Tracy Bui at the Worcester location, that unlicensed check cashing activity was being conducted. During the teleconference with Nikki Nguyen a/k/a Nikki H. Bui, she acknowledged that checks were being cashed at the Worcester location.  On May 7, 2009, the Division's examiners conducted another Visitation of the Worcester location. During the May 7, 2009 Visitation, Nikki Nguyen a/k/a Nikki H. Bui provided the Division's examiners a signed statement acknowledging that unlicensed check cashing activity was being conducted from the Worcester location (""Statement"").  The Statement signed by Nikki Nguyen a/k/a Nikki H. Bui indicated that the Corporation charged consumers $1.00 for cashing checks less than or equal to $1,000, and a fee of 0.75% of the total check amount for those checks in excess of $1,000.  The Statement also indicated that on a weekly basis, Ramos Market would cash third party checks of approximately fourteen thousand ($14,000) dollars. Those checks that were less than one thousand ($1,000) dollars would be deposited into a bank account maintained by the Corporation, and all checks in excess of $1,000 would be cashed by Nikki Nguyen a/k/a Nikki H. Bui or a representative of Ramos Market at a licensed check casher.  The Statement further revealed that in 2006 Nikki Nguyen a/k/a Nikki H. Bui had requested information from the Division about the check casher licensing process and an application ultimately was not filed because in accordance with her Statement, the""process was too difficult.""  The Division has reason to believe that Nikki Nguyen a/k/a Nikki H. Bui, Tracy Bui and Ramos Market continue to engage in the check cashing activity of at 6A Boylston Street, Worcester, Massachusetts, in violation of General Laws chapter 169A, section 2.  According to the Division's records, as of the date of this Temporary Order, neither Nikki Nguyen a/k/a Nikki H. Bui, Tracy Bui nor Ramos Market have applied or have obtained a license from the Commissioner pursuant to General Laws chapter 169A and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 45.00  et seq.,  to engage in the activity of a check casher at 6A Boylston Street, Worcester, Massachusetts. 	 ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration Paragraphs 2 through 13 herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that NIKKI NGUYEN a/k/a NIKKI H. BUI, TRACY BUI and RAMOS NEIGHBORHOOD MARKET, LLC shall immediately cease from engaging directly or indirectly in the check cashing business at 6A Boylston Street, Worcester, Massachusetts, and at any other locations in the Commonwealth without first obtaining a license from the Commissioner for such location(s) in accordance with Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169A and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 45.00  et seq.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that NIKKI NGUYEN a/k/a NIKKI H. BUI, TRACY BUI and RAMOS NEIGHBORHOOD MARKET, LLC shall, within ten (10) days of the effective date of this ORDER, provide the Division with a complete record of all checks cashed, including the dollar amount of the checks cashed and the fees charged by the Corporation to consumers during the period from July 10, 2007 through the effective date of this ORDER.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that NIKKI NGUYEN a/k/a NIKKI H. BUI, TRACY BUI and RAMOS NEIGHBORHOOD MARKET, LLC, shall, within thirty (30) days of the effective date of this ORDER, reimburse fees to all persons for whom a fee in excess of one dollar was charged by the Corporation for checks cashed between July 10, 2007 and the effective date of this ORDER. Reimbursements shall be made to each person on a per transaction basis in an amount equal to the entire portion of the check cashing fee charged by the Corporation for such transaction. A record shall be provided to the Division of the names and addresses of all individuals who have cashed checks with the Corporation, the amount of each transaction, the total fees charged on each transaction, check numbers of payments issued by the Corporation to evidence reimbursements made to consumers, and the amount reimbursed to each individual.     BY ORDER AND DIRECTION OF THE COMMISSIONER OF BANKS.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE BROKER  LICENSING  Docket No. 2009-008-OTSC  FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST &  ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE  In the Matter of  FARKHANDA TARAR SHAH  d/b/a EASTERN MORTGAGE  Somerville, Massachusetts  Mortgage Broker License No. MB4194  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that FARKHANDA TARAR SHAH d/b/a EASTERN MORTGAGE, (""Farkhanda Shah"" or ""Eastern Mortgage""), with her main business office located at 367 Broadway, Somerville, Massachusetts, has engaged in, or is engaged in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST & ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE AND NOTICE OF RIGHT TO A HEARING (collectively referred to as the ""Order"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E sections 6, 7(b), and 12 and General Laws chapter 255F section 12.  I. FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  A. FINDINGS OF FACT AND REGULATORY BACKGROUND  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  Farkhanda Shah is, and at all relevant times has been, an individual engaged in the business of a mortgage broker in the Commonwealth. Farkhanda Shah's main office is currently located at 367 Broadway, Somerville, Massachusetts.  Farkhanda Shah is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued mortgage broker license number MB4194 to Farkhanda Shah on or about December 7, 2005.  Mortgage brokers in Massachusetts are licensed and regulated under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, which is administered and enforced by the Commissioner. Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division is authorized to inspect the books, accounts, papers, records, and files of mortgage brokers transacting business in Massachusetts to determine compliance with the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E or any rule, or regulation issued thereunder, and with any law, rule, or regulation applicable to the conduct of the business of a mortgage broker.  On or about April 22, 2008, pursuant to the authority granted under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division commenced an examination/inspection of the books, accounts, papers, records, and files maintained by Farkhanda Shah to evaluate Eastern Mortgage's compliance with the laws, regulations, and regulatory bulletins applicable to the conduct of a mortgage broker business in Massachusetts (the ""2008 examination/inspection"").  The Division's Report of Examination/Inspection issued pursuant to the 2008 examination/inspection (the ""Report"") and provided to Farkhanda Shah on February 3, 2009, alleged significant failures to comply with applicable state and federal laws, rules, regulations, and regulatory bulletins governing the conduct of those engaged in the business of a mortgage broker in Massachusetts. The findings and conclusions of the Report are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference. 	  (i) Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices - Misrepresentation of Applicants' Residency Status  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) states: 	 Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1) states, in part: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to make any representation or statement of fact if the representation or statement is false or misleading or has the tendency or capacity to be misleading.  The Federal Reserve Board's Truth in Lending Official Staff Commentary to Regulation Z (""Staff Commentary"") addresses the definition of ""residential mortgage transaction"" as set forth in section 226.2(a)(24) of Regulation Z. The definition of ""residential mortgage transaction"" contains the term, ""principal dwelling."" The Staff Commentary clarifies that,  ""[a] consumer can only have  one  principal dwelling at a time. ""  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 32.27 states, in pertinent part: 	 Compliance with any provisions of the Federal Truth in Lending Act, the Board's Regulation Z, and the Official Staff Commentary, which does not conflict with M.G.L. c. 140D, 209 CMR 32.00 or an advisory ruling of the Commissioner, shall be deemed to be in compliance with M.G.L. c. 140D.  The Staff Commentary referenced in Paragraph 9 does not conflict with Massachusetts General Laws c. 140D, 209 CMR 32.00, or an advisory ruling of the Commissioner and is applicable in the Commonwealth.  Books and records reviewed during the 2008 examination/inspection indicated that Farkhanda Shah concealed and/or misrepresented information relating to the occupancy of subject properties in mortgage loan applications.  During the period from December 19, 2005 until June 9, 2006, Farkhanda Shah submitted seven (7) purchase money mortgage loan applications on behalf of a single borrower. Each of the seven applications indicated that the subject property was to be used as the borrower's primary residence. The settlement dates for the mortgage loans are as follows: December 19, 2005; January 6, 2006; February 10, 2006; February 12, 2006; February 21, 2006; May 31, 2006; and June 9, 2006. The examiners' specific findings are more fully described in the Report and are incorporated herein by reference.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners revealed that Farkhanda Shah submitted to separate lenders, refinance mortgage loan applications for two properties on behalf of a single borrower with each application indicating that the subject property was to be used as the borrower's primary residence. One application was taken on April 16, 2006 with a settlement date of June 7, 2006, while the other application was taken on June 5, 2006 with a settlement date of June 27, 2006. Therefore, both loans were in a pending status with Farkhanda Shah at the same time. The examiners' specific findings are more fully described in the Report and are incorporated herein by reference.  Farkhanda Shah knew or should have known that the information relating to the purpose of the loans in the mortgage loan applications set forth in Paragraphs 13 and 14 were inaccurate and knew or should have known that such information would have been relied upon in underwriting the mortgage loan by the mortgage lender or financial institution to which the mortgage loan applications were brokered by Farkhanda Shah. 	  (ii) Undisclosed Fees  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 183, section 63 states, in part: 	 A mortgagee, or a mortgage lender or mortgage broker as defined in section one of chapter two hundred and fifty-five E, shall not charge a loan fee, finder's fee, points, so-called, or similar fees in a mortgage transaction involving residential property located in the commonwealth of four or less units and occupied in whole or in part by the mortgagor, except to the extent that such fees or points have been previously disclosed to the mortgagor in writing, which disclosure may be in the form required by section seventeen D of chapter one hundred and eighty-four, or such other form which discloses said fees or points. A mortgagor shall not be obligated to pay fees or points which have not been previously disclosed as required herein.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection indicate, as more fully described in the Report, that Farkhanda Shah engaged in a pattern or practice of understatements or omissions of the fees charged to consumers by Eastern Mortgage.  Eastern Mortgage's books and records indicate that processing fees, origination fees, loan fees, or similar fees (collectively, ""broker fees"") were collected at the loan closing in amounts which Eastern Mortgage's books and records failed to illustrate had been fully and accurately disclosed to consumers, in writing, to the extent charged at closing, if at all, as more fully described in the Report.  Pursuant to the findings of the Report, the Division required that Farkhanda Shah reimburse the consumers identified in the Report for the amounts collected as a broker fee, loan fee, points or similar fee at settlement that had not been disclosed to the consumers, in writing, prior to loan closing. Farkhanda Shah was also required to conduct a portfolio review of all Massachusetts residential mortgage loans closed since December 7, 2005 and make all necessary reimbursements to borrowers for loan fees collected at closing that had not been previously disclosed by Farkhanda Shah. Farkhanda Shah was required to submit evidence of such reimbursements within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Report, which was issued on February 3, 2009.  To date, Farkhanda Shah has failed to submit evidence of the required reimbursements referenced in Paragraph 19. Upon information and belief, Farkhanda Shah is unable or unwilling to make the required reimbursements. 	  (iii) Unearned Fee  The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, (""RESPA"") implementing regulation, 24 CFR 3500.14(c) states, in part: 	 No person shall give and no person shall accept any portion, split, or percentage of any charge made or received for the rendering of a settlement service in connection with a transaction involving a federally related mortgage loan other than for services actually performed. A charge by a person for which no or nominal services are performed or for which duplicative fees are charged is an unearned fee and violates this section.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection indicate that Farkhanda Shah charged a consumer a ""final inspection fee"" for which no service was rendered by Eastern Mortgage.  Pursuant to the findings of the Report, the Division required that Farkhanda Shah reimburse the consumer identified in the Report for the full amount collected as a ""final inspection fee."" Farkhanda Shah was required to submit evidence of such reimbursement within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Report.  To date, Farkhanda Shah has failed to submit evidence of the required reimbursement referenced in Paragraph 23. Upon information and belief, Farkhanda Shah is unable or unwilling to make the required reimbursement. 	  (iv) Engaging Unauthorized Individuals to Originate Mortgage Loans on behalf of Farkhanda Shah in Massachusetts  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection indicate that Farkhanda Shah accepted applications from unlicensed individuals who were acting in the capacity of mortgage brokers as independent contractors.  By prior published opinions, the Division had set forth the standards which an unlicensed individual must satisfy, in advance, when seeking to operate in the capacity of a mortgage broker who is associated with and under the direction of a licensed mortgage broker under General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. (Through the enactment of SECTION 15 of Chapter 206 of the Acts of 2007, which added Chapter 255F to the General Laws of Massachusetts, the Commonwealth introduced the license requirement for individuals engaged in the activity of a ""mortgage loan originator"" as that term is defined in section 1 of said Chapter 255F. Consequently, the Division's published opinions referenced in Section I(A)(iv) of this Order became moot as of the effective date the statute, July 1, 2008. However, the referenced opinions were valid and enforceable at the time of the 2008 examination/inspection.)  Pursuant to the Division's advisory Opinion 97-222, dated December 19, 1997, among others, the Division established that exemption from licensure for individuals working under the direction of a licensed mortgage broker or mortgage lender is available only to individuals and not to a corporate entity. The relationship between the lender/broker licensee and the individual must be exclusive and the individual must execute an Exemption Affidavit to that effect. The licensee must execute a Statement of Accountability for all activities of the individual associated with it. The individual seeking the exemption must be primarily engaged in the activity it is seeking to perform under the direction of a licensed mortgage broker.  The Division's published Opinion 97-061 further stated that ""this exemption would be effective provided that the Licensee completes and files with the Division a Statement of Accountability agreeing to take responsibility for the exempt individual's activities and the individual seeking the exemption completes and files the required Exemption Affidavit.""  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that at least four individuals received compensation from Farkhanda Shah for engaging in mortgage broker activity on her behalf in the capacity of independent contractors. Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners also indicated that such individuals were not engaged in the activity of a mortgage broker as their primary occupation and, therefore, they did not satisfy the qualifying standards for unlicensed individuals acting in the capacity of mortgage brokers associated with and under direction of a licensed mortgage broker or mortgage lender as set forth by the relevant opinions published by the Division. Moreover, Farkhanda Shah did not file with the Division the required Exemption Affidavits and Statements of Accountability for any of the independent contractors who were operating on behalf of Eastern Mortgage. 	  (v) Loan Origination and Compensation Agreement  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(5) states in part: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker to fail to provide to the consumer at the time of application the loan origination and compensation agreement required under 209 CMR 42.16. The content of the agreement shall strictly conform to 209 CMR 42.16 and include signatures and dates by the consumer(s) and the mortgage broker.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.09(1)(b) states, in part: 	 Each mortgage broker . . . shall retain for a minimum of three years after a mortgage loan is made the following: the original loan origination and compensation agreement as set out in 209 CMR 42.16.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that Farkhanda Shah consistently failed to retain evidence of having provided the Loan Origination and Compensation Agreements. This practice was observed in all loan files reviewed during the 2008 examination/inspection. 	  (vi) Providing Mortgage Lender Disclosures to Consumers  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection indicate that Farkhanda Shah routinely provided consumers with several disclosures which are intended to be provided by the mortgage lender in the transaction, including but not limited to, Equal Credit Opportunity Notices, Truth in Lending Disclosures, and Notices to Applicant of Right to Receive Copy of Appraisals, as further described in the Report. Such activity was in excess of Farkhanda Shah's authority as a mortgage broker, pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. 	  (vii) Good Faith Estimate  At the time of the 2008 examination/inspection, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (""RESPA"") regulation 24 CFR 3500.7(b) stated, in part: 	 In the event an application is received by a mortgage broker who is not an exclusive agent of the lender, the mortgage broker must provide a good faith estimate within three days of receiving a loan application  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.09(1)(b) states, in part: 	 Each mortgage broker . . . shall retain for a minimum of three years after a mortgage loan is made the following . . . correspondence; papers or records relating to the loan; and such other documents as the Commissioner may require.  Books and records reviewed during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that, in several loan files reviewed, Farkhanda Shah failed to retain evidence of having provided the Good Faith Estimate, as further described in the Report. 	  (viii) Failure to Provide Fair Credit Reporting Act Disclosure  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(12) states: 	 ""It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker or mortgage lender to engage in a pattern or practice of failing to make any disclosure to a consumer required by and at the time specified by any applicable state or federal law, regulation or directive.""  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that Farkhanda Shah consistently failed to retain evidence of having provided applicants with the credit score disclosure required under Section 609(g) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 [15 U.S.C. § 1681g(g)]. This practice was observed in all loan files reviewed during the Examination/Inspection. 	  (ix) Use of Misleading Information in Documents Provided to Consumers  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1) states, in part: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to make any representation or statement of fact if the representation or statement is false or misleading, or has the tendency or capacity to be misleading.  Books and records reviewed during the 2008 examination revealed that Farkhanda Shah routinely provided applicants with a Borrower's Certification and Authorization Form that contained language that was false or misleading or had the tendency or capacity to be false or misleading. Specifically, the Borrower's Certification and Authorization Form contained language which presented the appearance that Farkhanda Shah was approving or funding the mortgage loan, as specifically described in the Report. 	  (x) Failure to Properly Use and Maintain Books and Records  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8 states in part: 	 A licensee shall keep and use such business records in such form and at such location as said commissioner shall, by regulation, determine, which shall enable said commissioner to determine whether such licensee is complying with the provisions of this chapter and any rules or regulations promulgated hereunder by said commissioner and any other law, rule or regulation applicable to the conduct of the business for which it is licensed under this chapter.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.09(1) states: 	 Each Licensee shall keep and use its books, records and accounts in a manner which will allow the Commissioner to determine whether the Licensee is complying with the provisions of M.G.L. c. 255E and applicable state and federal laws and regulations. Each Licensee shall comply with the provisions of 209 CMR 48.00...  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2008 examination/inspection indicated that Farkhanda Shah retained several loan files that did not contain dated mortgage loan applications. By failing to document the date of application, Farkhanda Shah failed to retain sufficient documentation to enable the Division's examiners to determine whether Eastern Mortgage was complying with the timing requirements in which certain disclosures must be provided to consumers. 	  (xi) Failure to Notify the Division of the Closing and Relocation of Licensed Office Location  The Division's Regulation 209 CMR 42.13(2) states: 	 Licensees shall provide thirty days prior written notice of any change or closing of a Massachusetts location to the Commissioner and shall contain such other information as the Commissioner may require.  Books and records reviewed during the 2008 examination/inspection revealed that Farkhanda Shah failed to provide thirty days prior notice of the relocation of Eastern Mortgage's main office from Peabody, Massachusetts to Somerville, Massachusetts. Specifically, books and records indicated that Eastern Mortgage was conducting mortgage broker activity from the Somerville location starting in March, 2006 but notification of the office relocation was not received by the Division until August 8, 2006. 	  (xii) Failure to Respond to the Division  On February 3, 2009, Farkhanda Shah appeared at the Division's Boston office for an informal conference to discuss the Division's findings, as set forth in the Report. At that time the Report was provided to Farkhanda Shah. During the informal conference the Division notified her that, as a result of the numerous compliance violations cited in the Report, the Division would be requiring a Consent Order (""Consent Order""). The Division also informed Farkhanda Shah that a detailed written response to each of the matters addressed in the Report would be required, including evidence of consumer reimbursements, within thirty (30) days of her receipt of the Report.  To date, Farkhanda Shah has failed to submit the required detailed written response to the Report. 	 B.

177,6/22/2021,2009,Cease Directive,"Jackson Hewitt, Inc. and BVIG Financial, LLC","Check Casher,Electronic Fund Transfer",Deceptive Business Practices: Misrepresentation of Occupancy Status,???,https://www.mass.gov/cease-directive/jackson-hewitt-inc-and-bvig-financial-llc," COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  Suffolk, SS.  COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  CHECK CASHER LICENSING  AND ELECTRONIC FUND  TRANSFER APPROVALS  CEASE DIRECTIVE  In the Matter of  JACKSON HEWITT, INC., Parsippany, New Jersey  and BVIG FINANCIAL, LLC, Houston, Texas  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") is charged with the administration of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169A, and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 45.00  et seq.,  relating to the licensing of check cashers; and Massachusetts General Laws chapter 167B and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 31.00  et seq.,  relating to the operation of electronic funds transfer systems through electronic branches by both banks and non-banks.  Pursuant to the authority granted by Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169A and Massachusetts General Laws chapter 167B, the Commissioner has investigated the activities of JACKSON HEWITT, INC., (""Jackson Hewitt"") located at 3 Sylvan Way, Suite 301, Parsippany, New Jersey and BVIG FINANCIAL, LLC, (""BVIG Financial"") located at 2425 West Loop South, Suite 865, Houston, Texas, to determine if Jackson Hewitt and BVIG Financial have engaged in the business of, or are about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169A, and Massachusetts General laws chapter 167B. Based upon such investigations, the Division determined that while Jackson Hewitt and BVIG Financial appeared to be separate unrelated entities, both operated in what the Division considers to be a joint enterprise and hereby issues the following CEASE DIRECTIVE (""Cease Directive"") as a result of the findings alleged herein.  A. FINDINGS OF FACT  I. Unlicensed Check Cashing Activity  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169A, section 2 relative to the licensing requirements for entities engaged in the business of check cashing states: 	 No person or entity shall engage in cashing checks, drafts or money orders for a consideration in excess of one dollar per item without first obtaining a license from the commissioner...The commissioner shall establish rules and regulations, which may include an adequate capitalization requirement, for each place of business or mobile unit of a licensee to aid in the administration and enforcement of this chapter.  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a check casher in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws 169A, section 2 and its implementing regulation 209 CMR 45.00  et seq .  Jackson Hewitt is, and at all relevant times, has been a foreign corporation doing business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts with a principal office located at 3 Sylvan Way, Suite 301, Parsippany, New Jersey.  Jackson Hewitt maintains and operates several office locations in the Commonwealth from which it offers tax preparation services to consumers in the Commonwealth.  BVIG Financial is, and at all relevant times, has been a foreign corporation doing business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts with a principal office located at 2425 West Loop South, Suite 865, Houston, Texas.  On February 27, 2009, the Division was forwarded a copy of a receipt processed by a check-cashing machine maintained by BVIG Financial and operated on the premises of a Jackson Hewitt office at 574 Washington Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts (""Dorchester location"").  The receipt received by the Division and dated February 24, 2009 reflected a transaction for a check of $654.27 that was cashed at the check-cashing machine operated by BVIG Financial and located at the Dorchester location for fee of $20.27.  As a result of the events referenced in Paragraphs 6 and 7 of this Directive, on March 4, 2009, the Division's examiners conducted a visitation of the Dorchester location (""Visitation"").  The Division's examiners determined that a machine that operated as a check cashing machine and an Automated Teller Machine, (""ATM"" as defined herein) were located and operated on the premises of the Dorchester location and according to disclosures on the machines, were operated by BVIG Financial.  The disclosures on the check-cashing machine maintained by BVIG Financial and operated on the premises of the Dorchester location, indicated that the check-cashing fee was 2.99% with a minimum fee of $5.00 per transaction. The receipt received by the Division and referenced in Paragraphs 6 and 7 of this Directive revealed, however, that the transaction fee was in excess of the 2.99% rate stated and was 3.10% or $20.27.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169A, section 13 states: 	 Whoever violates any provision of section two or any rule or regulation made thereunder by the commissioner shall be punished by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars or by imprisonment for not more than six months, or both. Each day a violation continues shall be deemed a separate offense.  According to the Division's records, as of the date of this Directive, Jackson Hewitt has not filed an application with the Division to obtain a check casher license.  According to the Division's records, as of the date of this Directive, BVIG Financial has not filed an application with the Division to obtain a check casher license. 	 II. Operating Unauthorized Electronic Funds Transfer Services  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 167B and its implementing regulation 209 CMR 31.00  et seq.,  requires entities seeking to purchase, establish, install, operate, lease, use, or share a non-bank electronic branch, hereinafter referred to as ATM, to file an application, with the Commissioner for a decision, prior to providing electronic funds transfer services.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 167B, section 1, in part defines an electronic branch as: 	 An electronic device, other than a telephone operated by a consumer, through which a consumer may initiate an electronic fund transfer. Such term includes, but is not limited to automated teller machines and cash dispensing machines.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 167B, section 4 states in part: 	 An application filed with the commissioner to purchase, establish, install, operate, lease, use or share an electronic branch shall contain the following information:  (a) the type of electronic branch applied for;  (b) the site location of such electronic branch with a general description of the surrounding area;  (c) the services which may be performed at such electronic branch;  (d) whether the electronic branch will credit or debit a customer's account immediately or on a delayed basis;  (e) a description of the bonding or the contractual responsibilities for any losses or unauthorized transactions if such electronic branch is manned by a third party employee;  (f) if the electronic branch is to be shared, a list of other participants and a copy of the leasing agreement;  (g) the name and address of the owner of the electronic branch, and if such owner is a subsidiary of another corporation, the name and address of the parent corporation;'.  (h) details regarding the applicant's insurance program and, in particular, considerations made relative to the proposed electronic branch;  (i) an outline of the security provisions for the protection of the electronic branch and the customers using it;  (j) the manner in which the electronic branch will be activated;  (k) copies of all agreements or proposed agreements relating to the operation or use relative to such electronic branch;  (l) a copy of any contract between a financial institution and its customers;  (m) if the electronic branch is owned by the applicant, a description of the fixed assets costs and estimated operating expenses; and  (n) any such other information which the commissioner shall require by rules and regulations.  A schedule of all existing service charges or fees on any account and a schedule of charges assessed to financial institutions to use the electronic branch shall accompany each application.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 167B, section 5 states in part: 	 No financial institution shall invest in or contract for the services of any organization unless such organization has been approved in writing by the commissioner and the financial institution has obtained a copy of such approval'.  An organization seeking to purchase, establish, install, operate, lease, use or share an electronic branch for the purpose of providing electronic fund transfers for financial institutions shall comply with the provisions of section four. An application by an organization under said section four may list one or more financial institutions to which the organization plans to provide services, or with which or on behalf of which it plans to purchase, establish, install, operate, lease, use or share an electronic branch and may be supplemented from time to time by the addition of other such financial institutions.  The visitation to the Dorchester location referenced in Paragraphs 8 through 10 of this Directive, revealed that an ATM was operated by BVIG Financial and operated on the premises of the Dorchester location.  The disclosures on the ATM maintained by BVIG Financial and operated on the premises of the Dorchester location indicated that the ATM services were conducted on behalf of BVIG Financial and included a contact number for BVIG Financial.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 167B, section 22(a) states in part: 	 Whenever the commissioner has reason to believe that any person is in violation of any provision of this chapter, and that proceedings would be in the public interest, the commissioner may request the attorney general to bring an action in the name of the commonwealth against such person to restrain the violation by temporary restraining order or preliminary or permanent injunction. The action may be brought in the superior court of the county in which such person resides or has his principal place of business, or the action may be brought in the superior court of Suffolk county with the consent of the parties or if the person has no place of business within the commonwealth. Said court may issue temporary restraining orders or preliminary or permanent injunctions.  According to the Division's records, as of the date of this Directive, Jackson Hewitt has not filed an application to operate an ATM with the Division.  According to the Division's records, as of the date of this Directive, BVIG Financial has not filed an application to operate an ATM with the Division. 	 B. CEASE DIRECTIVE  Jackson Hewitt and BVIG Financial are hereby directed to cease engaging in the check cashing business until such time that Jackson Hewitt and BVIG Financial have individually demonstrated that they are exempt from the licensing provisions of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169A and its implementing regulation 209 CMR 45.00 et seq., or have obtained a license issued by the Commissioner of Banks for the check cashing business in Massachusetts.  Jackson Hewitt and BVIG Financial are hereby directed to cease providing electronic funds transfer services until such time that Jackson Hewitt and BVIG Financial have individually demonstrated that they are exempt from the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 167B and its implementing regulation 209 CMR 31.00  et seq.,  or have filed an application and received approval to offer such services by the Commissioner of Banks.

The requirements of this paragraph shall not prohibit the Bank from renewing, after collecting in cash all interest and fees due from a borrower, any credit already extended to the borrower.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE BROKER  LICENSING  Docket No. 2009-016-OTSC  ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE  AND NOTICE OF RIGHT  TO A HEARING  In the Matter of  AMERICAN ADVISORS GROUP  Irvine, California  Mortgage Broker License No.: MB5106  ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLAINT  The Commonwealth of Massachusetts Division of Banks (the ""Division""), by and through the Commissioner of Banks of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the ""Commissioner  "") , for its Order to Show Cause and Notice of Right to a Hearing (""Order and Notice""), alleges as follows:  The Division brings this action under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 to obtain temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief, ordering AMERICAN ADVISORS GROUP (""American Advisors"" or the ""Corporation""), a licensed mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2 and its implementing regulation 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , to cease and desist from transacting business in the Commonwealth as a mortgage broker; revocation of American Advisors' Massachusetts mortgage broker license, number MB5106; and such other equitable relief as may be necessary due to American Advisors' failure to maintain and exercise the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that its business will be operated honestly, fairly, soundly, and efficiently in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 42.06(2)(c). 	 JURISDICTION AND VENUE  The Division, through the Commissioner, is an agency of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts with jurisdiction over matters relating to the licensing and operation of those persons engaged in the business of a mortgage broker pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E.  The Division, through the Commissioner, also has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons engaged in the business of a mortgage loan originator in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 2 and its implementing regulation 209 CMR 41.00  et seq .  At all relevant times, American Advisors has been engaged in the business of a mortgage broker of residential property in Massachusetts. 	 RESPONDENT  At all relevant times, American Advisors has been a foreign corporation conducting business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts with its main office is located at 16808 Armstrong Avenue, Suite 220, Irvine, California.  American Advisors is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage broker license, license number MB5106 to American Advisors to engage in the business of a mortgage broker on or about May 20, 2008. License number MB5106 authorized American Advisors to conduct its mortgage broker business from the Corporation's main office located at 16808 Armstrong Avenue, Suite 220, Irvine, California. 	 REGULATORY BACKGROUND  On September 24, 2008, the Division issued a TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST, Docket No. 2008-022 (the ""Temporary Order""), against American Advisors based upon information reflected in a consumer solicitation regarding reverse mortgage loans received by Massachusetts consumers from American Advisors which contained language that had the tendency to be false or misleading.  On October 21, 2008, American Advisors entered into a STIPULATION AND CONSENT TO THE ISSUANCE OF A CONSENT ORDER (""Consent Order"") with representatives of the Division, to resolve matters identified in the Temporary Order. The Consent Order is incorporated herein by reference. 	 (i) Substantial Non-Compliance with the Terms of a Consent Order  Paragraph 1(a) of the Consent Order states: 	 American Advisors shall revise its advertising practices and procedures to ensure that all solicitations and advertising materials used by the Corporation do not contain any representations or statements that could be considered false, misleading, or have the tendency or capacity to be misleading.  American Advisors shall take all necessary steps to ensure that the Solicitation or any similar solicitation is not published or distributed to consumers in Massachusetts;  Paragraph 8 of the Consent Order states: 	 Failure to comply with the terms of this Consent Order shall constitute grounds for license suspension and/or revocation pursuant to applicable provisions of the General Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) states: 	 Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1) states, in part: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to make any representation or statement of fact if the representation or statement is false or misleading or has the tendency or capacity to be misleading.  On or around April 15, 2009, the Division received from a consumer, a copy of a reverse mortgage loan solicitation (""Solicitation"") received by a Massachusetts consumer from American Advisors.  A copy of the Solicitation is attached as Exhibit 1    . The format of the Solicitation forwarded to the Division was in a similar format to the consumer solicitation previously issued by American Advisors and referenced in Paragraph 7 of this Order and Notice.  The Solicitation was mailed from the ""Administrative Offices"" of the Corporation and contained a header, entitled ""2009 Economic Stimulus Plan-HECM PROGRAM,"" and contained a reference to a property identification number. The body of the Solicitation referenced a ""2009 Increased Lending Limit"" of $417,000, a dollar amount that was inaccurate based upon an additional reference to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act which increased the reverse mortgage maximum claim amount to $625,500. The Solicitation further indicated that the increased lending limit would only be available through the end of 2009. The Solicitation also included information that outlined the ""Estimated Qualification Based on FHA Lending Limits,"" which reflected information about the targeted consumers age, monthly disbursement, lump sum payment qualification as well as the available credit line, under a reverse mortgage program. The reflected information included a reference to a footnote located adjacent to each of the aforementioned factors-age, monthly disbursement, lump sum payment qualification and credit line-in a font size that was significantly smaller to the pertinent information. The information that was contained in the footnote was located on the reverse side of the Solicitation and was in a lighter color text and set in a light background, which made the information difficult to read.  The information reflected in the footnote of the Solicitation discussed the potential factors that would limit the payment streams including a final appraisal of the property and other ancillary costs associated with obtaining a reverse mortgage loan, concerns that were raised by the Division at the time of the issuance of the Temporary Order previously issued by the Division and referenced in Paragraph 7 of this Order and Notice, since this information was cited as critical information that would be important for a consumer to know prior to entering into a reverse mortgage transaction.  On or around April 21, 2009 the Division was forwarded a copy of another consumer solicitation received by a Massachusetts consumer that contained similar language to the April 15, 2009 Solicitation forwarded to the Division. The format of the April 21, 2009 solicitation was a duplicate of the past mailing forwarded by the Corporation, to Massachusetts consumers and referenced in Paragraph 13 of this Order and Notice, however the April 15, 2009 solicitation contained a reference to the proceeds of the reverse mortgage being ""TAX FREE income"" with a footnote reference in a font that was smaller advising the consumer to seek advice from a tax advisor, this additional information was also located on the reverse side of the Solicitation in a lighter color text and set in a light background, which made the information difficult to read. A copy of the Solicitation is attached as Exhibit 2  Both Solicitations forwarded to Massachusetts consumers notified consumers that additional information would be provided to the consumer, without risk or obligation if the consumer contacted the Corporation before April 24, 2009.  The Division's review of the Solicitations referenced in Paragraph 13 and 16 of this Order and Notice and mailed to Massachusetts consumers revealed that the Solicitations were significantly similar to the consumer solicitation mailed to Massachusetts and referenced in Paragraph 7 of this Order and Notice.  On or around April 24, 2009, the Division's representatives contacted American Advisors via teleconference to discuss the concerns raised by the events referenced in Paragraphs 13 through 17 of this Order and Notice. During the teleconference, American Advisors informed the Division's representatives that only a ""couple of thousand"" Solicitations had been mailed to Massachusetts consumers.  In a letter dated May 1, 2009 to the Division, American Advisors indicated that approximately 16,000 Solicitations had been mailed to Massachusetts consumers, in a subsequent communication with the Division, American Advisors indicated that approximately 20,000 solicitations had been mailed to consumers.  On or around May, 11, 2009, the Division forwarded a request via e-mail to American Advisors and requested that the following items be forwarded to Division by May 15, 2009: 	 A complete loan list of all loans originated to Massachusetts consumers since October 1, 2008 to present;  A complete listing of all 16,000 consumers who received the Solicitations;  American Advisors current financial statements; and  Copies of the policies and procedures implemented by the Corporation to approve the Solicitations.  On May 15, 2009, in response to the Division's request, American Advisors forwarded the requested information to the Division. The information provided revealed that approximately 24,576 Solicitations had been forwarded to Massachusetts consumers. 	 (ii) Failure to Disclose Mortgage Broker License Number  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.15 states in part; 	 A Licensee shall also disclose the type and number of its license(s) in all advertisements.  The Solicitations forwarded to Massachusetts consumers and referenced in Paragraphs 13, and 16 of this Order and Notice included an incorrect reference to the Massachusetts mortgage broker license held by American Advisors. 	 (iii) Failure to Provide Notification of Regulatory Actions  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.12(1)(c) states, in part: 	 A Licensee shall notify the Commissioner immediately, and in writing within one business day, of the occurrence of any of the following significant developments: . . . (c) Receiving notification of the institution of license denial, cease and desist, suspension or revocation procedures, or other formal or informal regulatory action, in any state against the Licensee, and the reasons thereof.  On December 16, 2008, the State of Washington's Department of Financial Institutions issued a Statement of Charges (Docket No.: C-08-353-08-SC01), (""Statement of Charges"") against American Advisors, Reza Jahangiri, sole owner of American Advisors and two additional individuals associated with the Corporation.  The Statement of Charges alleged that: 	 American Advisors engaged in unfair or deceptive practices by engaging in false and deceptive advertising by mailing approximately 72,000 Washington state consumers a direct mail solicitation designed to resemble a government mailing, similar to that mailed to Massachusetts consumers and referenced in Paragraph 7 of this Order and Notice;  American Advisors engaged in apparent violations of the Federal Trade Commission Act as a result of the information contained in the direct mailings forwarded to approximately 72,000 consumers; and  American Advisors failed to notify the Director of State of Washington's Department of Financial Institutions within 10 days of the filing of the Temporary Order issued by the Division and referenced in Paragraph 7 of this Order and Notice.  As of the effective date of this Order and Notice, the Division has not received notification from American Advisors of the occurrence of the events referenced above in Paragraphs 26 and 27 of this Order and Notice. 	 (iv) Failure to Implement and Maintain Required Revised Procedures  Paragraph 1(c) of the Consent Order states: 	 American Advisors shall revise its advertising practices and procedures to ensure that all solicitations and advertising materials used by the Corporation do not contain any representations or statements that could be considered false, misleading, or have the tendency or capacity to be misleading.  American Advisors shall establish, implement and maintain policies and procedures to ensure that all advertisements are thoroughly reviewed by senior management prior to publication or distribution to consumers. Such procedures shall include a review of the criteria utilized to generate mailing lists to ensure that targeted solicitations are appropriate for the consumers to whom such solicitations are distributed;  A review of the Solicitations distributed by American Advisors to approximately 24,000 Massachusetts consumers revealed that American Advisors forwarded Massachusetts consumers Solicitations that contained an inaccurate reference to the Corporation's license and inaccurate information about the provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act as they related to reverse mortgages.  A review of the information provided to the Division pursuant to Paragraph 21 of this Order and Notice, specifically, the Corporation's marketing policies and procedures revealed that American Advisors failed to ensure that all advertisements were reviewed by senior management prior to publication and distribution, as the policies and procedures provided to the Division simply indicated that the ""Compliance Department"" reviewed all marketing pieces prior to external counsel reviewing the document. 	 (v) Failure to Provide Access to Books and Records  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8 states, in part, that: 	 Each licensee shall, when directed by said commissioner, permit said commissioner or his duly authorized representative to inspect its relevant records and evidence of compliance with the provisions of this chapter or any rule or regulation issued hereunder and with any other law, rule or regulation applicable to the conduct of the business for which it is licensed under this chapter . . . . For the purposes of such inspection, said commissioner or his representative shall have access to the offices and place of business, books, accounts, papers, records and files of all such licensees.  The Division's regulation governing the maintenance of books and records, at 209 CMR 48.04 states, in part: 	 ""Each Licensee shall keep and use its books, records, and accounts within the Commonwealth, except, however, that with the prior approval by the Commissioner of a written plan, a Licensee may keep such books, records, and accounts at a location, or locations, outside of the Commonwealth. Such written plan shall contain:  (1) an agreement to provide access, within 72 hours of an official request, to any requested books, records, and accounts to a suitable and mutually agreed upon location within the Commonwealth for the purpose of examination…""  Pursuant to the Division's regulation 209 CMR 48.04, the Commissioner approved American Advisors out-of-state record keeping plan, allowing the Corporation to maintain its books and records at its main office in Irvine, California.  The out-of-state record keeping plan referenced in Paragraph 34 of this Order and Notice provides that, in response to a request from the Division, American Advisors shall send requested books, records and accounts to the Division's offices in the Commonwealth for the Division's examination/inspection purposes.  On Thursday, February 26, 2009, pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division requested access to American Advisor's books and records for the purpose of assessing the Corporation's level of compliance with applicable Massachusetts statutes and the Division's regulations governing the conduct of those engaged in the business of a mortgage broker in the Commonwealth.  On February 26, 2009, the Division's examiner e-mailed American Advisors a ""first-day letter"" to an e-mail address provided by the Corporation to the Division and maintained in the Division's records. The ""first day letter"" required that the requested information be made available to the Division no later than ten business days from the date of the letter. The records requested included, but were not limited to: 	 Copies of four (4) Massachusetts owner-occupied residential loan files in their entirety processed by the Corporation; and  A list of all loans processed for owner-occupied residential property in Massachusetts since being licensed.  As of the April 24, 2009, teleconference held with American Advisors and referenced in Paragraph 19 of this Order and Notice, the Corporation had not complied with the Division's request for books and records.  On or around April 27, 2009, the Division notified American Advisors of the Corporation's failure to comply with the Division's request and American Advisors thereafter forwarded the requested files to the Division, which were subsequently received on June 1, 2009. 	 VIOLATIONS  NOW THEREFORE, the Division hereby sets for the Charges against American Advisors:  The Division re-alleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 39 of this Order and Notice as though fully set forth.  CHARGE ONE:  American Advisors has failed to demonstrate the character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).  CHARGE TWO:  By mailing Massachusetts consumers Solicitations containing false or misleading language, or language that had the tendency to be false or misleading, including inaccurate statements regarding the lending limits for reverse mortgage transactions, American Advisors has violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a), and the Office of the Attorney General's implementing regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1) and the Consent Order.  CHARGE THREE:  By mailing Massachusetts consumers Solicitations that failed to disclose the license number held by American Advisors, the Corporation has violated the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.15.  CHARGE FOUR : American Advisors failed to notify the Commissioner in writing, within one business day, that on December 16, 2008 the State of Washington's Department of Financial Institutions issued a Statement of Charges against American Advisors in violation of the Division's Regulation 209 CMR 42.12(1)(c).  CHARGE FIVE:  American Advisors failed to establish, implement and maintain policies and procedures to ensure that all advertisements were thoroughly reviewed by senior management prior to publication and distribution to consumers in violation of Paragraph 1(c) of the Consent Order.  CHARGE SIX:  American Advisors failed to provide the Division's representatives with access to the Corporation's books, accounts, records and files to permit an inspection of such records, in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8.  CHARGE SEVEN:  American Advisors failed to provide the Division's representatives with access to the Corporation's books, accounts, records and files to permit an inspection in violation of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 48.04(1), which requires that such records be provided within 72 hours of an official request and in violation of American Advisors' out-of-state record keeping plan approved pursuant thereto.  CHARGE EIGHT:  Had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of American Advisors' original mortgage broker license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 39 present sufficient grounds for the revocation of American Advisors' mortgage broker license pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.07(2)(b). 	 PRAYER FOR RELIEF  WHEREFORE, the Division, by and through the Commissioner  ,  prays for a final decision as follows: 	 For a final Agency decision awarding temporary and preliminary injunctive relief, and any other ancillary relief, as may be necessary to protect the public interest during the pendency of this matter.  For a final Agency decision in favor of the Division and against American Advisors for each Charge set forth in this Order and Notice.  For a final Agency decision ordering American Advisors to cease and desist from transacting business in Massachusetts as a mortgage broker.  For a final Agency decision ordering American Advisors to immediately place any pending residential mortgage loan applications and related files with an independent, licensed Massachusetts mortgage lender or other qualified lender in Massachusetts, with no costs to the applicant.  For a final Agency decision revoking American Advisors' mortgage broker license, number MB5106 to conduct business as a mortgage broker in Massachusetts.  For costs and fees of the Division's investigation of this matter; and  For such additional equitable relief as the Presiding Officer may deem just and proper.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  FOREIGN TRANSMITTAL  AGENCY LICENSING  Docket No. 2009-114  FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  DOUBLES BUILDING SOCIETY, LLC  d/b/a SMALL FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION  Worcester, Massachusetts  Foreign Transmittal Agency License Nos.  FT5741 and FT6557  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that DOUBLES BUILDING SOCIETY, LLC d/b/a SMALL FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION, located at 1078 West Boylston Street, Suite 204, Worcester, Massachusetts, (""Doubles Building Society"" or the ""Company"") has engaged, or is engaged in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169, and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 44.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST pursuant to General Laws chapter 169, section 13(b).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons engaged in the business of a foreign transmittal agency pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169.  Doubles Building Society is, and at all relevant times has been, a limited liability company conducting business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Doubles Building Society's main office is located at 1078 West Boylston Street, Suite 204, Worcester, Massachusetts.  Bernard Kamiri is, and at all relevant times has been, the sole Member/Manager of Doubles Building Society.  Doubles Building Society is licensed by the Commissioner as a foreign transmittal agency under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a foreign transmittal license to Doubles Building Society on or about September 26, 2007, with license number FT5741. License number FT5741 authorizes Doubles Building Society to operate as a foreign transmittal agency at 1078 West Boylston Street, Worcester, Massachusetts.  Doubles Building Society maintains an additional licensed office location at 604 Central Street, Lowell Massachusetts, from which the Company conducts its foreign transmittal business.  Doubles Building Society is a money service business within the meaning of The Bank Secrecy Act (""BSA"") and its implementing regulation at 31 C.F.R. Part 103  .  Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169, section 10, the Division conducted an inspection of the books, accounts, papers, records, and files of Doubles Building Society on January 23, 2009 (the ""examination/inspection"").  The Division's Report of Examination/Inspection (the ""Report""), which was issued to Doubles Building Society on the effective date of this Temporary Order, presented the findings of the 2009 examination/inspection and alleged significant failures to comply with applicable state and federal laws, rules, and regulations governing the conduct of those engaged in the business of a foreign transmittal agency in Massachusetts. 	 A. COMMINGLING FUNDS IN CLIENT TRUST ACCOUNTS  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 44.07 states, in part: 	 (1) All funds of clients deposited with a Licensee for transmittal to a foreign country shall be deposited in one or more trust accounts maintained at a federally insured bank. Said account(s) shall contain only those funds collected for transmittal. . . . (4) No person licensed as a foreign transmittal agency shall commingle money collected for transmission abroad from clients with its own funds or use any part of a client's money in the conduct of the Licensee's business.  The Company maintains escrow accounts with three financial institutions. These three accounts hold funds collected for transmittal as well as fees paid to the Company by the consumer for the transmittal service. The examination/inspection revealed that Mr. Kamiri's personal funds were also deposited into one of these accounts. Moreover, a review of the account statements for this particular account for the period September, 2007 through January, 2009 revealed that the Company used the account to hold monies which were used to pay for the Company's operating expenses, including: rent; office supplies; utilities; and advertising. 	 B. ENGAGING IN FOREIGN TRANSMITTAL BUSINESS IN MASSACHUSETTS FROM UNLICENSED LOCATIONS  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169, section 6 states, in part: 	 Each [foreign transmittal agency] license shall state the name and address of the licensee and the city or town of the place where such business is to be carried on. If a licensee intends to carry on a business at more than one location, such licensee shall procure a license for each location where such business shall be conducted.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 44.09(1) states: 	 A Licensee shall obtain a separate license under M.G.L. Chapter 169 and 209 CMR 44.00 in order to conduct business at another location.  The examination revealed that the Company conducted three transactions between July, 2008 and September, 2008 from Sunrise Boutique located at 286 West 6  th  Street in Lowell. The Company failed to submit a license application, or obtain a license from the Division to conduct business from that location.  Books and records reviewed during the examination/inspection revealed that the Company conducted seven transactions between September, 2008 and December, 2008 from LP International located at 604 Central Street in Lowell. The Company failed to obtain a license to conduct business from that location until on or about April 8, 2009. 	 C. Failure to Implement an Effective Anti-Money Laundering Program  The BSA's implementing regulation at 31 C.F.R. 103.125 states, in part: 	 (a) Each money services business . . . shall develop, implement and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program . . . . that is reasonably designed to prevent the money services business from being used to facilitate money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities.  (b) The program shall be commensurate with the risks posed by the location and size of, and the nature and volume of the financial services provided by, the money services business.  (c) The program shall be in writing, and a money services business shall make copies of the anti-money laundering program available for inspection to the Department of the Treasury upon request…""  The BSA's implementing regulation at 31 C.F.R. 103.125(d) requires that money services businesses implement written anti-money laundering policies and procedures that, at a minimum: (1) incorporate policies and procedures and internal controls reasonably designed to assure compliance with this part, including requirements verifying customer identification, filing reports, creating and retaining records, and responding to law enforcement requests; (2) designate a person to assure day to day compliance with the program; (3) provide for education and/or training of appropriate personnel, including training in the detection of suspicious transactions; and (4) provide for independent review to monitor and maintain an adequate program. 	 (i) Policies, Procedures and Internal Controls  The examination/inspection revealed that Doubles Building Society's policies, procedures, and internal controls were insufficient to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and were not commensurate with the risks posed by the financial services offered by the Company, as specifically set forth below. 	 Doubles Building Society's anti-money laundering manual does not include requirements for responding to law enforcement requests or for identifying transactions designed to evade reporting requirements that would require the filing of a Suspicious Activity Reports by Money Services Business (""SAR-MSB"").  The Company's procedures require that currency transaction reports (""CTRs"") be filed for currency transactions equal to or exceeding $9,000, which is not in compliance with the BSA's implementing regulation at 31 C.F.R. 103.22(b)(1) which requires that CTRs be filed for transactions in currency of more than $10,000.  A review of the Company's anti-money laundering manual revealed that the Company's written procedures for verifying customer identification are deficient because the procedures: are not sufficiently detailed; do not provide for the retention of customer identification or for the creation of customer profiles; and are not commensurate with the risks posed by the financial services provided by the Company, as more fully described in the Report. Moreover, discussions with Bernard Kamiri revealed that many of the procedures written into the Company's compliance manual regarding customer identification do not reflect actual practice.  A review of Doubles Building Society's Company's anti-money laundering program revealed that record retention procedures are not adequate because the information retained by the Company can only be reviewed by transaction date and the database does not permit the Company to search transactions by individual customer.  (ii) Designated Compliance Officer  The BSA's implementing regulation at 31 C.F.R. 103.125(d)(2) states, in part: 	 [The money services business' anti-money laundering program shall] [d]esignate a person to assure day to day compliance with the program and this part. The responsibilities of such person shall include assuring that: (i) The money services business properly files reports, and creates and retains records, in accordance with applicable requirements of this part; (ii) The compliance program is updated as necessary to reflect current requirements of this part, and related guidance issued by the Department of the Treasury; and (iii) The money services business provides appropriate training and education in accordance with paragraph (d)(3) of this section.  Doubles Building Society has designated a compliance officer. However, the examination/inspection revealed that the compliance officer failed to effectively perform the required duties and appeared to lack the skills and knowledge necessary for that position. Specifically, as explained in more detail in this Temporary Order and in the Report, the compliance officer failed to ensure that the anti-money laundering program reflects the current requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act. Furthermore, the compliance officer has failed to properly file reports and provide appropriate training and education. 	 (iii) Education and Training  The BSA's implementing regulation at 103 C.F.R. § 103.125(d)(3) states: 	 [The money services business' anti-money laundering program shall] [p]rovide education and/or training of appropriate personnel concerning their responsibilities under the program, including training in the detection of suspicious transactions to the extent that the money services business is required to report such transactions under this part.  Doubles Building Society's training program requires appropriate personnel to read the compliance manual and take a compliance quiz. However, because the compliance manual is considered deficient, as further described above and in the Report, the training program is not considered to be adequate. Moreover, the Company failed to maintain documentation to support its training program. 	 ( iv) Independent Review  The BSA's implementing regulation at 31 C.F.R. § 103.125(d)(4) states: 	 [The money services business' anti-money laundering program shall] [p]rovide for independent review to monitor and maintain an adequate program. The scope and frequency of the review shall be commensurate with the risk of the financial services provided by the money services business. Such review may be conducted by an officer or employee of the money services business so long as the reviewer is not the person designated in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.  The examination/inspection revealed that Doubles Building Society has no procedures in place to provide for independent review of its anti-money laundering program. Upon inquiry, Bernard Kamiri informed the Division's examiners that the Company was not aware that such independent review was required. 	 D. Failure to register with the Department of Treasury  The BSA's implementing regulation at 31 C.F.R. 103.41(a) (1) states, in part: 	 Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, relating to agents, each money services business (whether or not licensed as a money services business by any State must register with the Department of the Treasury and, as part of that registration, maintain a list of its agents as required by 31 U.S.C. 5330 and this section…  The BSA's implementing regulation at 31 C.F.R. 103. 41(b)(2) states, in part: 	 A money services business must be registered for the initial registration period and each renewal period. The initial registration period is the two-calendar-year period beginning with the calendar year in which the money services business is first required to be registered…  The BSA's implementing regulation at 31 CFR 103.41(4) states, in part: 	 [I]f a money service business experiences a more than 50-per cent increase in the number of its agents during any registration period, the money services business must be re-registered…  Books and records reviewed during the examination/inspection revealed that Doubles Building Society initially registered with the Department of Treasury on September 5, 2006. However, the Company failed to re-register at the end of the two-calendar-year registration period ending December 31, 2008. Furthermore, the Company failed to re-register with the Department of Treasury when the Company began to utilize a more than 50-percent increase in its number of agents to accept deposits for foreign transmittal operations. 	 E. PRESENTING THE APPEARANCE THAT THE cOMPANY'S BUSINESS IS THAT OF A BANK  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 44.10 states, in part: 	 Prohibited practices that are grounds for license revocation under M.G.L Chapter 169 Section 12 and the issuance of a cease and desist order under M.G.L. Chapter 169 Section 13 shall include the act of, ""(2) implying that it is a bank or to act in any manner so as to lead the public to believe that its business is that of a bank or otherwise violate the unauthorized banking provisions of M.G.L. Chapter 167 Section 37.  The Division's examiners reviewed the Company's website, www.doublesbuildingsociety.com, and determined that the website presented the appearance that the Company engages in banking services. Specifically, the website advertises banking services including savings, lending, and mortgage services. In addition, the Division's examiners observed similar advertisements of such banking services at the (unlicensed) offices in Lowell and the main office in Worcester. 	 F. FAILURE TO PROPERLY MAINTAIN AND PROVIDE FOR INSPECTION OF BOOKS AND RECORDS  Massachusetts General Laws, chapter 169, section 10 states, in part: 	 A licensee shall, when directed by the commissioner, permit the commissioner or his duly authorized representative to inspect its records and evidence of compliance with this chapter or any rule or regulation issued thereunder and with any other law, rule and regulation applicable to the conduct of its business. For the purposes of such inspection, the commissioner or his representative shall have access to the offices and place of business, books, accounts, papers, records and files of licensee.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 44.05(1) states: 	 Each Licensee shall keep and use within the Commonwealth its books, records and accounts in a manner which will allow the Commissioner to determine whether the Licensee is complying with the provisions of M.G.L. c. 169 and applicable state and federal laws and regulations.  During the examination/inspection, the Company was unable to produce any 2008 financial statements. Therefore, the Division's examiners were unable to make a determination regarding the Company's financial responsibility. 	 G. FAILURE TO DISCLOSE THE TYPE AND NUMBER OF ITS LICENSE TO CLIENTS  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 44.10 states, in part: 	 Grounds for license revocation under M.G.L. c. 169, § 12 and the issuance of cease and desist orders under M.G.L. c. 169, § 13 shall include, but are not limited to, the following prohibited acts and practices by Licensees: . . .(3) failing to disclose the type and number of its license(s) to all clients in writing at the time deposits for transmittal abroad are accepted or to fail to disclose the type and number of its license(s) in all advertisements . .  Books and records reviewed during the examination/inspection revealed that the Company failed to disclose its license type and number on: its website, www.doublesbuildingsociety.com; remittal receipts provided to clients at the time of deposit for transmittal abroad; and advertisements located in the office locations. 	 Conclusions of Law  Based on the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 34, Doubles Building Society has failed to demonstrate the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169, section 6 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 44.03.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 34. Doubles Building Society commingled money collected for transmission abroad from clients with its own funds, in violation of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 44.07.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 34, Doubles Building Society conducted its foreign transmittal business in Massachusetts from an unlicensed location, in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169, section 6 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 44.09(1).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 34, Doubles Building Society failed to implement an effective anti-money laundering program commensurate with the risks posed by the location and size of, and nature and volume of the financial services provided by the Company, in violation of 31 C.F.R. 103.125.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 34, Doubles Building Society failed to register with the Department of Treasury, in violation of 31 C.F.R. 103.41.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 34, Doubles Building Society's advertisements presented the appearance that the Company's business is that of a bank, in violation of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 44.10.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 34, Doubles Building Society failed to provide the Division with certain books and records, in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169, section 10 and the Division's regulations 209 CMR 44.05(1).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 34, Doubles Building Society failed to disclose the type and number of its license to clients, in violation of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 44.10.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 34, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 Doubles Building Society has engaged, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that the Company is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a foreign transmittal agency including, but not limited to, the provisions under General Laws chapter 169 and the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 44.00  et seq .  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to Doubles Building Society.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 34, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of Doubles Building Society's original foreign transmittal agency license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. 	 ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that Doubles Building Society, any and all officers, directors, employees, independent contractors, or agents operating on behalf of Doubles Building Society, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging directly or indirectly in the business of a foreign transmittal agency in Massachusetts, as defined in M.G.L. chapter 169, section 1, except as otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Temporary Order.

WASHINGTON CO-OPERATIVE BANK, South Boston, Massachusetts (Bank), having been advised of its right to a Notice of Charges and of Hearing detailing the unsafe or unsound banking practices alleged to have been committed by the Bank, and of its right to a hearing on such alleged charges under section 8(b) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (Act), 12 U.S.C. § 1818(b), and having waived those rights, and having waived any rights that the Bank has or may have under the Massachusetts General Laws, entered into a STIPULATION AND CONSENT TO THE ISSUANCE OF AN ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (CONSENT AGREEMENT) with a representative of the Legal Division of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and with the Commissioner of Banks of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (Commissioner), dated July 13, 2009, whereby solely for the purpose of this proceeding and without admitting or denying any unsafe or unsound banking practices, the Bank consented to the issuance of an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (ORDER) by the FDIC and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Division of Banks (Division).

WHEREAS , on or about April 22, 2008, pursuant to the authority granted under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division commenced an examination/inspection of the books, accounts, papers, records, and files maintained by Farkhanda Tarar Shah d/b/a Eastern Mortgage (""Farkhanda Shah"" or the ""Respondent"") to evaluate the Respondent's compliance with the laws, regulations, and regulatory bulletins applicable to the conduct of a mortgage broker business in Massachusetts.

FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW     The Commissioner finds that the matters asserted, as set forth in paragraphs 1 through 47, inclusive, of the Order and Notice shall constitute findings of fact, and that paragraphs 48 through 62 of the Order and Notice shall constitute conclusions of law.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE LOAN  ORIGINATOR LICENSING  Docket No. 2009-015-MLO  FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  NATALIE VLASOVA  Mortgage Loan Originator License No. MLO42121  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that NATALIE VLASOVA., has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 41.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""Temporary Order"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255F, section 8(b).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage loan originator in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 2.  The Division, through the Commissioner, also has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2 and its implementing regulation at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq .  Mortgage loan originators in Massachusetts are licensed and regulated under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, which is administered and enforced by the Commissioner.  Natalie Vlasova is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage loan originator under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage loan originator license, license number MLO42121 to Natalie Vlasova to engage in the business of a mortgage loan originator on or about September 3, 2008.  According to the Division's records, at all relevant times, Natalie Vlasova was employed as a mortgage loan originator by Dynamic Capital Mortgage, Inc., (""Dynamic Capital"" or the ""Corporation"").  Dynamic Capital is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage lender and mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner issued a mortgage company license, license number MC2201 to Dynamic Capital to engage in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker on or about August 8, 2002. License number MC2201 authorized Dynamic Capital to conduct the mortgage company business from the Corporation's main office located at 1371 Beacon Street, Suite 301, Brookline, Massachusetts.  Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division is authorized to inspect the books, accounts, papers, records, and files of mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers transacting business in Massachusetts to determine compliance with the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E or any rule, or regulation issued thereunder, and with any law, rule, or regulation applicable to the conduct of the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker.  On January 12, 2009 pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division commenced an examination/inspection of the books, accounts, papers, records, and files maintained by Dynamic Capital to evaluate the Corporation's compliance with the laws, regulations, and regulatory bulletins applicable to the conduct of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker business in Massachusetts (the ""2009 examination/inspection"").  The Division's Report of Examination/Inspection on Consumer Compliance (the ""Report""), presented the findings of the 2009 examination/inspection and alleged significant failures to comply with applicable state and federal laws, rules, regulations, and regulatory bulletins governing the conduct of those engaged in the business of a mortgage broker and mortgage lender in Massachusetts.  During the 2009 examination/inspection of Dynamic Capital, the Division's examiners determined that Natalie Vlasova, while employed at Dynamic Capital as a mortgage loan originator, prepared mortgage loan applications on behalf of borrowers over a period of three years for the purchase and/or refinance of various residential properties as defined pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, and Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 1 (hereinafter referred to as ""multi-family properties""), that were ultimately converted into condominium units. A review of the loan files originated by Natalie Vlasova indicate that income information, Verification of Deposit (""VOD"") Forms, Verification of Employment (""VOE"") forms, property valuation reports and employment information maintained in the loan files and reviewed by the Division's examiners reflected information that appeared to be inaccurate and/or misleading. 	 Unfair or Deceptive Acts and Practices  a. Deceptive Business Practices  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) states: 	 Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 41.09(1) states: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a Licensee to engage in conduct prohibited under 2  09 CMR 42.12A.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(8), states: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker of mortgage lender to falsify income or asset information on a mortgage loan application or mortgage loan documents.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 11(a) states; 	 Whenever the commissioner finds that any licensee has violated this chapter or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder, or any other law of the commonwealth applicable to the conduct of a mortgage loan originator on residential property in the commonwealth, the commissioner may, by order, in addition to any other action authorized under this chapter or any rule or regulation made thereunder, impose a penalty upon the person which shall not exceed $5,000 for each violation up to a maximum of $100,000 for such violation plus the costs of investigation. The commissioner may impose a penalty which shall not exceed $5,000 for each violation of this chapter, or any rule or regulation promulgated hereunder, by a person other than a licensee, plus the costs of investigation.  A review of loan files originated by Natalie Vlasova indicate, that while employed as a loan originator at Dynamic Capital, Natalie Vlasova prepared multiple loan applications on behalf of several borrowers connected through a realty company, over a three year period for the purchase and refinance of numerous multi-family properties located in the Dorchester/Roxbury neighborhoods of Boston, Massachusetts. A review of the documents maintained in the loan files revealed that borrowers, sellers, real estate agents and family members involved in the transactions appeared to work at the same realty company or were representing themselves to be employed by the same restaurant in Dorchester. These individuals, hereinafter referred to as Borrower A, Borrower B, Borrower C and Borrower D, acting in various capacities, were involved in the purchase of multi-family properties and conversion of those properties to condominium units and subsequent sale of the units at what appear to be inflated values. Dynamic Capital was the mortgage lender of record in several transactions involving both the initial purchase of the multi-family properties as well as the subsequent purchases and refinances of individual condominium units. Additionally, all mortgage loans were 100% loan to value and often one borrower, Borrower A, would appear as the attorney in fact for other borrowers at settlement. A review of registry records reveals that properties were converted and sold several times and ultimately subject to foreclosure proceedings as fully described in the Report.  Dynamic Capital was the mortgage lender of record in several transactions involving both the purchase of the multi-family properties as well as the subsequent purchases and refinances of individual condominium units. The loan originator of record on all of the relevant loan files was Natalie Vlasova. Examples include but are not limited to the following: 	 (a) Borrower A, Borrower B & Loan Originator: Natalie Vlasova - Property Address: Esmond Street Dorchester, Massachusetts  A review of loan files and registry records indicate that the seller of record purchased the multi-family property at a foreclosure sale for $285,000 on August 1, 2006 and subsequently sold the property to a borrower (""Borrower A"") on October 2, 2006 for $540,000.  A review of registry records indicates that a Master Deed creating a condominium with four units was recorded on behalf of Borrower A on or around October 12, 2006, approximately ten (10) days after the initial purchase of the property.  Borrower A refinanced one unit, Unit 2, of the condominium obtaining a loan in the amount of $197,250 on November 29, 2006 with Dynamic Capital as the lender of record. Borrower A received approximately $79,924.06 in cash at settlement. 		 The loan application taken on or around November 14, 2006, prepared by Natalie Vlasova, as the loan originator of record, indicated that Borrower A earned approximately $9,760 monthly or $117,000 annually as a real estate agent. The loan application noted that the borrower maintained two accounts at a regional bank and noted the account numbers on the loan application.  Verification of Deposit Forms (""VOD"") maintained in the loan file indicate that the borrower maintained three accounts at a regional bank, two accounts were in the name of Borrower A and a management company jointly and one account was maintained by Borrower A solely.  One of the two account numbers noted on the loan application was not referenced on the VOD's maintained in the loan file and appeared to be an unrelated fourth account.  Borrower A sold the remaining three units to one borrower (""Borrower B""), in three separate transactions, on November 14, 2006 (Unit 4), November 16, 2006 (Unit 1) and November 30, 2006 (Unit 3). The three units were sold to Borrower B for $182,000, $260,000 and $175,000 respectively.  Borrower B purchased the fourth unit, Unit 2 for $260,000 from Borrower A on or around February 17, 2007 approximately three months after Borrower A refinanced Unit 2 from which Borrower A received approximately $79,924.06 in cash at settlement.  Documents retained in the loan files maintained by Dynamic Capital indicate that Borrower B applied for financing from Dynamic Capital for at least one of the three units purchased, Unit 4, however, a purchase and sale agreement for one of the remaining units, Unit 3, was maintained in the loan file. Natalie Vlasova was the loan originator of record.  All four units purchased by Borrower B were ultimately foreclosed upon in 2007 and 2008 and thereafter purchased by a third party. 		 On May 26, 2009, Unit 3 was sold to a third party for $30,000.  On May 1, 2009, Unit 4 was sold to a third party for $40,000.  On July 17, 2008, Unit 2 was sold to a third party for $95,000.  On April 9, 2008, Unit 1 was sold to a third party for $30,000.  (b) Borrower A & Loan Originator: Natalie Vlasova - Property Address: Hawthorne Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts  A review of loan files and registry records indicate that Borrower A purchased the multi-family property with Dynamic Capital as the lender of record on December 22, 2006 for $420,000. Copies of the loan documents indicate that the borrower had applied for 100% financing through a stated income loan program. 		 A loan application dated November 13, 2006 and prepared by Natalie Vlasova, as the loan originator of record indicated that the borrower earned approximately $13,000 monthly or $156,000 annually as a real estate agent. The loan application referenced three accounts maintained by the borrower at a regional bank. 			 The loan application prepared by Natalie Vlasova for the purchase of Hawthorne Street was taken within a day of the application prepared by Natalie Vlasova for the refinance of the Esmond Street condominium unit as referenced in Paragraph 16(a)(iii)(a). However, the income noted on the purchase money application for Hawthorne Street was reflected as $13,000 monthly or $156,000 annually and the refinance loan application for Unit 2, of the Esmond Street Condominium noted the income as $9,760 monthly or $117,000, a difference of $39,000 annually.  The VOD's maintained in the loan file for the refinance of Unit 2 of the Esmond Street Condominium and referenced in Paragraph 16(a)(iii)(b) of this Temporary Order, were maintained in the loan file for the purchase of the Hawthorne Street property by Borrower A.  Documents retained in the loan file indicate that Borrower A had contributed approximately $21,000 as a down payment for the purchase of the property.  Settlement documents retained in the file indicate that Borrower A ultimately received approximately $24,139 in cash back at settlement.  On or around May 16, 2007, Borrower A converted the property into three condominium units and sold the condominium units for $320,000, $212,000 and $325,000 between May 16, 2007 and July 2007.  (c) Borrower C & Loan Originator: Natalie Vlasova - Property Address: Waumbeck Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts  A review of loan files and registry records indicate that Borrower C purchased a condominium unit, Unit 2, for $280,000 on March 29, 2007, with Dynamic Capital as the lender of record. Borrower A signed all settlement documents as the attorney in fact for Borrower C.  A loan application prepared on or around March 5, 2007 by Natalie Vlasova as the loan originator of record indicated that Borrower C and a co-borrower noted on the loan application both resided in Maine. Borrower C and the co-borrower appear to be related to Borrower A or they share the same last name. The application noted that Borrower C was employed as a product manager for approximately one month at an establishment in Dorchester, Massachusetts. Borrower C's employer was also the seller of record of the subject property, and co-owner of the establishment that Borrower C was employed at. 		 The loan application prepared by Natalie Vlasova, indicated that Borrower C's monthly income was $10,000 monthly or $120,000 annually. The loan application noted assets in the form of a bank account with the same account information as that noted in Borrower A's refinance of Unit 2, of the Esmond Street Condominium and referenced in Paragraph 16(a)(iii)(b) of this Temporary Order. In addition, the assets also noted a vested interest in a retirement account that was determined to be the co-borrower's retirement account as evidenced by a retirement statement maintained in the loan file. 			 Subsequent applications retained in the loan file removed the co-borrower from the loan application however the final loan application included the retirement income as an asset.  A VOD maintained in the loan file was dated March 2, 2007 a date prior to the application date and the VOD referenced an account number that was inconsistent to that noted on the application. The VOD appeared to have been returned by the bank on March 21, 2007.  A verbal verification of employment (""VOE"") maintained in the loan file was completed on April 2, 2007 four days after settlement and indicated that the borrower had been employed since April 1, 2007, a date subsequent to the settlement date.  According to records maintained at the registry of deeds, Borrower C sold Unit 2 on July 2, 2008 for $350,000, at an apparent increase in value of $70,000 over a 16-month period.  (d) Borrower D and Loan Originator: Natalie Vlasova - Property Address: Waumbeck Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts  A review of loan files and registry records indicate that Borrower D purchased one condominium unit, Unit 3, for $250,000 on March 29, 2007, with Dynamic Capital as the lender of record. Borrower A signed all settlement documents as the attorney in fact for Borrower D.  A loan application prepared on or around March 5, 2007 by Natalie Vlasova as the loan originator of record, indicated that Borrower D was employed as an Assistant Manager for approximately two years at an establishment in Dorchester, Massachusetts. This same establishment was also listed as the employer for Borrower C.  Borrower D's employer was also the seller of record and co-owner of the establishment in Dorchester. The loan application noted that the Borrower D held a second job as a self-employed bartender. 		 The loan application prepared by Natalie Vlasova, indicated that Borrower D's monthly income was $2,083 with commissions of $1,250 and other income of $1,900 from a second job for a total of $5,233 monthly or $67,796 annually. The loan application noted a bank account as an asset however, failed to include an account number.  A VOD located in the loan file and requested by Natalie Vlasova on March 5, 2007, referenced an account number that was the same account number that was noted on Borrower A's loan file refinancing of Unit 2 of the Esmond Street Condominium as noted in Paragraph 16(a)(iii)(b) of this Temporary Order. The completed VOD appeared to have been returned by the bank on March 21, 2007.  A verbal verification of employment (""VOE"") maintained in the loan file was completed on April 2, 2007 four days after settlement and noted that the borrower had been employed for two years.  According to records maintained at the registry of deeds, Borrower D sold the condominium unit on August 5, 2008 for $360,000, at an apparent increase in value of $110,000 over a 17-month period.  (e) Borrower E, Borrower A and Loan Originator: Natalie Vlasova - Property Address: Boyd Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts  A review of loan files and registry records indicate that Borrower E purchased a multi-family property at a foreclosure sale for $377,000 on June 1, 2007. The lender of record for the mortgage recorded simultaneously with the deed was Dynamic Capital. Borrower A signed the mortgage as attorney in fact for Borrower E.  A review of registry records indicates that Borrower E converted the property into a condominium on or around June 29, 2007, and the Master Deed was recorded with the registry of deeds on July 17, 2007.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2009 examination/inspection revealed that Borrower A purchased one unit, Unit 3 on or around August 31, 2007 for $280,000. 		 A loan application prepared by Natalie Vlasova as the loan originator of record, noted that Borrower A earned $9,000 monthly or $108,000 annually as a real estate manager, other income for a second job at the same realty company that Borrower A was a manager at was noted as $5,000 monthly or $60,000 annually for total annual income of $168,000. Registry records indicate that Dynamic Capital was the lender of record.  A certificate of entry, and foreclosure deed evidencing foreclosure proceedings of Unit 3 were filed at the registry of deeds on October 20, 2008. On January 23, 2009, the Unit was sold to a third party for $56,650. 		 Dynamic Capital knew or should have known that information collected by the Corporation during the processing and/or underwriting of the aforementioned mortgage loans would be relied upon by the mortgage lender, financial institution or investor to which the mortgage loans were brokered and/or sold by Dynamic Capital.  Natalie Vlasova, as a mortgage loan originator acting on behalf of Dynamic Capital, should have known that information collected by the her as the mortgage loan originator of record, during the processing and/or underwriting of the mortgage loans would be relied upon by the mortgage lender, financial institution or investor to which the mortgage loans were brokered and/or sold by Dynamic Capital. 	 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 17, Natalie Vlasova has failed to demonstrate and maintain the character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that Natalie Vlasova, as a licensed mortgage loan originator will act honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 4 and the Division's regulations 209 CMR 41.03(2)(b).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 17, by submitting misleading and/or inaccurate information to mortgage lenders, financial institutions or investors to whom Dynamic Capital brokered and/or sold mortgage loans to Natalie Vlasova acting as a loan originator on behalf of Dynamic Capital, has violated Division's regulation 209 CMR 41.09(1), 209 CMR 42.12A(8) and Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 17, by falsifying borrowers' income information on Uniform Residential Loan Applications submitted in connection with residential mortgage transactions, Natalie Vlasova has violated the Division's regulation 209 CMR 41.09(1), 209 CMR 42.12A(8) and Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 17, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 Natalie Vlasova has engaged in, is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that it is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage loan originator including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 41.00 et seq.; and  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to Natalie Vlasova.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 17, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of Natalie Vlasova's original mortgage loan originator license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 17 present sufficient grounds for the revocation of Natalie Vlasova's mortgage loan originator license pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 7 and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 41.04(2)(c)(1), 209 CMR 41.04(2)(c)(2) and 209 CMR 41.04(2)(c)(3). 	 ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that Natalie Vlasova shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of a mortgage loan originator, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Temporary Order. Therefore, Natalie Vlasova is ordered to immediately cease soliciting or accepting, either directly or indirectly, any residential mortgage loan applications from consumers for residential property located in Massachusetts.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Temporary Order shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 30A.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Temporary Order shall not be construed as approving any act, practice, or conduct not specifically set forth herein which was, is, or may be in violation of relevant state or federal laws and regulations.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such Temporary Order shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from Natalie Vlasova within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this Temporary Order. If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this Temporary Order shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.     BY ORDER AND DIRECTION OF THE COMMISSIONER OF BANKS.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE LENDER  LICENSING  Docket No. 2009-115  FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  TAYLOR, BEAN, AND WHITAKER  MORTGAGE CORP.  Ocala, Florida  Mortgage Lender License No(s). ML1897  et al.  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that TAYLOR, BEAN & WHITAKER MORTGAGE CORP., (""Taylor, Bean & Whitaker"" or the ""Corporation""), located at 315 NE 14th Street, Ocala, Florida has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""Temporary Order"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b) and chapter 255F, section 8(b).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage lender in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  The Division, through the Commissioner, also has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons engaged in the business of a mortgage loan originator in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 2.  Taylor, Bean & Whitaker is, and at all relevant times, has been a foreign corporation conducting business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Taylor, Bean & Whitaker's main office is located at 315 NE 14th Street, Ocala, Florida.  Taylor, Bean & Whitaker is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage lender under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued mortgage lender license number ML1897 to Taylor, Bean & Whitaker to engage in the business of a mortgage lender at 315 NE 14th Street, Ocala, Florida on or about September 7, 2001.

According to records maintained on file with the Division, Taylor, Bean & Whitaker currently possesses eight (8) additional mortgage lender licenses from the Commissioner for one location operating in Massachusetts, as well as locations operating outside the Commonwealth. 	 A. Failure to Fund Certain Residential Loan Obligations in the Commonwealth and Uncertainty of Taylor, Bean & Whitaker's Maintenance of the Minimum Financial Requirements for Holding a Mortgage Lender License in Massachusetts  i. Failure to Fund Certain Residential Loan Obligations in the Commonwealth  On August 5, 2009, a licensed Massachusetts mortgage broker (""Mortgage Broker A"") notified the Division that Taylor, Bean & Whitaker, had failed to timely disburse loan proceeds in a refinance mortgage loan transaction involving a residential property in Massachusetts which Mortgage Broker A had placed with Taylor, Bean & Whitaker. Mortgage Broker A informed the Division that the mortgage loan had closed on July 30, 2009 and was scheduled to fund on August 4, 2009. As of August 6, 2009, the mortgage loan remains unfunded.  On August 5, 2009, the Division was notified via an e-mail forwarded by a licensed mortgage broker (""Mortgage Broker B"") that Corporation had ceased all origination operations effective immediately. Mortgage Broker B notified the Division that Taylor, Bean & Whitaker had e-mailed the mortgage broker a press release that stated in part: 	 Taylor, Bean & Whitaker Mortgage Corp., (""TBW"") received notification on August 4, 2009 from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae (the ""Agencies"") that it was being terminated and/or suspended as an approved seller and/or servicer for each of those respective agencies...As a result of these actions, TBW must cease all origination operations effectively immediately...TBW will not be able to close or fund any mortgage loans currently pending in its pipeline.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) states: 	 Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12(1)(e) states in part: 	 A Licensee shall notify the Commissioner immediately, and in writing within one business day, of the occurrence of any of the following significant developments...expiration, termination or default, technical or otherwise, of any existing line of credit or warehouse credit agreement.  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.13(2) states: 	 Licensees shall provide thirty days prior written notice of any change or closing of a Massachusetts location to the Commissioner and shall contain such other information as the Commissioner may require.  Based upon information and belief, the loan referenced in Paragraph 6 has not yet funded as of the effective date of this Temporary Order.  As of the issuance of this Temporary Order, Taylor, Bean & Whitaker has not notified the Division of the facts and circumstances set forth above. 	 ii. Uncertainty of Taylor, Bean & Whitaker's Maintenance of the Minimum Financial Requirements for Holding a Mortgage Lender License in Massachusetts  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.04(2)(b)3 pertaining to the licensing of mortgage lenders states in part: 	 The Commissioner may also deny such an application if the Applicant has: conducted, or will conduct, its business in an unsafe and unsound manner...  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.03(2)(c) states in part: 	 An Applicant shall be required to submit detailed information supporting the following general requirements:  Character and Fitness. An Applicant shall submit information demonstrating that the Applicant possesses the character, reputation, integrity and fitness to engage in the business of a mortgage lender in an honest, fair, sound and efficient manner.  On or around August 5, 2009 the Division became aware that Taylor, Bean & Whitaker had ceased all origination operations and would be unable to close or fund any mortgage loans pending in the Corporation's pipeline by an e-mail forwarded by the Corporation to a Massachusetts licensed mortgage broker, Mortgage Broker B. The e-mail stated in part: 	 TBW must cease all origination operations effectively immediately...TBW will not be able to close or fund any mortgage loans currently pending in its pipeline.  B. Failure to Provide Notice of Suspension of Relationship with the Government National Mortgage Association  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.12(1)(f) states in part: 	 (1) A Licensee shall notify the Commissioner immediately, and in writing within one business day, of the occurrence of any of the following significant developments: . . . (f) Suspension or termination of the Licensee's status as an approved seller or seller/servicer by the Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, Government National Mortgage Association or an investor approved under  209 CMR 42.11A(1)(a) .  On August 4, 2009, the Division became aware through a press release issued by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (""HUD"") that the Federal Housing Administration (""FHA"") had suspended Taylor, Bean & Whitaker from making loans insured by FHA. The press release further stated that the Government National Mortgage Association (""Ginnie Mae"") was defaulting and terminating Taylor, Bean & Whitaker as an issuer in Ginnie Mae's mortgage backed security program and would be terminating Taylor, Bean & Whitaker's ability to continue servicing Ginnie Mae securities.  As of the issuance of this Temporary Order, Taylor, Bean & Whitaker has not notified the Division of the aforementioned events. 	 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 18, Taylor, Bean & Whitaker's acts or practices of contracting with consumer(s), through the underwriting and subsequent execution of mortgage loan closing documents relating to Massachusetts residential property, and thereafter failing to fund the mortgage loan(s) may constitute unfair and/or deceptive acts or practices in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 18, due to the delay in funding contractual mortgage loan obligations Taylor, Bean & Whitaker has harmed a consumer, mortgage broker, and other parties in at least one residential mortgage loan transaction in the Commonwealth by engaging in acts or practices which may be unfair and/or deceptive in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 18, by contracting to originate mortgage loan(s) that Taylor, Bean & Whitaker did not have sufficient warehouse funds available to fund, or any other available alternative source of funds, Taylor, Bean & Whitaker has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices in violation of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.04(2)(b)3.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 18, Taylor, Bean & Whitaker failed to notify the Commissioner within one business day of the termination of the Corporation's relationship with the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Government National Mortgage Association in violation of 209 CMR 42.12(1)(f).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 18, Taylor, Bean & Whitaker failed to provide the Commissioner with thirty days prior written notice of the Corporation's intention to cease business operations in violation of 209 CMR 42.13(2).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 18, Taylor, Bean & Whitaker has failed to demonstrate the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.03(2)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 18, the public interest will be harmed by delay in issuing an Order to Cease and Desist under General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(a) because, upon information and belief, Taylor, Bean & Whitaker has a portfolio of Massachusetts mortgage loan applications in various stages of processing, underwriting, and funding which require immediate action to protect the interests of the affected Massachusetts consumers. Contrary to these interests, Taylor, Bean & Whitaker has announced its intention to cease all origination operations immediately and has already begun failing to fund residential mortgage loan transaction(s) which were scheduled to fund prior to the effective date of this Temporary Order.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 18, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 Taylor, Bean & Whitaker has engaged in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that it is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage lender including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. ; and  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to Taylor, Bean & Whitaker.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 18, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of Taylor, Bean & Whitaker's original mortgage lender license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 18 present sufficient grounds for the revocation of Taylor, Bean & Whitaker's mortgage lender license pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.04(2)(b). 	 ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that Taylor, Bean & Whitaker and any and all officers, directors, managers, employees, independent contractors or agents operating on behalf of Taylor, Bean & Whitaker, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of: (a) a mortgage lender, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, and (b) a mortgage loan originator, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Temporary Order. Therefore, Taylor, Bean & Whitaker is ordered to immediately cease soliciting or accepting, either directly or indirectly, any residential mortgage loan applications from consumers for residential property located in Massachusetts.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Taylor, Bean & Whitaker, shall immediately place any fees previously collected from Massachusetts consumers relative to any pending mortgage loan applications in a separate escrow account maintained at a federally insured bank.

In the event that no such placement can be made, Taylor, Bean & Whitaker shall either independently fund the mortgage loan under such terms and conditions or buy down the mortgage loan offered by the lender so that the applicant does not incur a loss as a result of such placement. Taylor, Bean & Whitaker shall obtain the prior approval of the Commissioner before placing such applications to the qualified lender(s) or broker(s) as appropriate.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that in any instance in which Taylor, Bean & Whitaker failed to fund a closed loan and in which the consumer, prior to the effective date of this Temporary Order, obtained funding through an alternate lender, Taylor, Bean & Whitaker shall reimburse each consumer the amount necessary to put the consumer in the same position as if Taylor, Bean & Whitaker had funded the mortgage loan under the terms and conditions agreed upon at the closing of the loan.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Taylor, Bean & Whitaker shall submit to the Commissioner a detailed record, prepared as of the date of submission, of all of the Corporation's pending residential mortgage loan applications on property located in Massachusetts. The records to be produced shall include all information on file regarding the Corporation's Massachusetts mortgage loan portfolio, including but not necessarily limited to, the following: 	 Within one (1) day of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, Taylor, Bean & Whitaker shall submit to the Commissioner all information on file as of the date of submission regarding the Corporation's portfolio of mortgage loans that were closed by Taylor, Bean & Whitaker prior to the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, but remain as yet unfunded.

The record should include telephone numbers of contact persons at each lender who is familiar with the Corporation's submitted loans;  As soon as possible, but not later than five (5) days after the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, Taylor, Bean & Whitaker shall submit to the Commissioner all information on file as of the date of submission regarding the Corporation's pipeline of pending mortgage loan applications including but not limited to, the following: The names of all individuals from whom Taylor, Bean & Whitaker has accepted an application for a residential mortgage loan; the applicants' addresses and telephone numbers; the loan number; the amount of all prepaid loan fees submitted by the customer; rate lock status; the amount of each loan; application status (i.e. filed, submitted to lenders, cleared to close, etc.); loan terms, if approved; scheduled closing dates; the loan purpose (i.e. purchase or refinance); and identification of the applicable lender or broker with whom each application will be placed. The record should include telephone numbers of contact persons at each lender or broker who is familiar with the Corporation's submitted loans;  On the last business day of each subsequent week after the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, Taylor, Bean & Whitaker shall provide the Commissioner with an updated, written status report of the mortgage loan applications identified above under subparagraphs 32(a) and 32(b). The form of the status report shall follow the format of the initial submission under subparagraphs 32(a) and 32(b) and shall indicate the final disposition of the loan application and include the final terms under which each approved loan is closed. The reporting requirement shall continue until each of the approved applications is placed with a lender and funded, funded by Taylor, Bean & Whitaker, or withdrawn by the applicant(s); and  Within one (1) day of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER, Taylor, Bean & Whitaker shall submit to the Commissioner Taylor, Bean & Whitaker's balance sheet and year-to-date income statement, prepared as of the date of submission, and attested by a duly authorized officer of the Corporation. The balance sheet shall indicate Taylor, Bean & Whitaker's cash position at each of its depository banks as well as Taylor, Bean & Whitaker's bank account numbers.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Taylor, Bean & Whitaker shall not pay or declare a dividend, nor otherwise authorize or execute any financial transaction, either singular or structured, in excess of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.00), except for wages and salaries paid to employees, contractors, officers, or other members of Taylor, Bean & Whitaker's management in the normal course of their business, without the prior written approval of the Commissioner. Upon the effective date of this Temporary Order, Taylor, Bean & Whitaker shall implement or revise its practices and procedures, as necessary, to ensure that their financial books and records are accurately maintained, in a manner illustrating compliance with the provisions of this Paragraph, and available for review by the Division's examiners upon request.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Taylor, Bean & Whitaker shall immediately secure all pending mortgage loan application files and, to the extent that any original documents must be forwarded to the relevant mortgage lender(s) and or mortgage broker(s) pursuant to Paragraph 30 of this TEMPORARY ORDER, a copy of such document, correspondence, or paper relating to the mortgage loan shall be retained in Taylor, Bean & Whitaker's books and records and shall be available to the Commissioner, in their entirety, upon request.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Temporary Order shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 30A.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such Temporary Order shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from Taylor, Bean & Whitaker within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this Temporary Order. If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this Temporary Order shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.     BY ORDER AND DIRECTION OF THE COMMISSIONER OF BANKS.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE LENDER AND  MORTGAGE BROKER  LICENSING  Docket No. 2009-121  FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  QUOTEMATCH, LLC  San Diego, California  Mortgage Broker License No. MB4312  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that QuoteMatch, LLC (""QuoteMatch"" or the ""Licensee""), with its main address located at 9950 Summers Ridge Road, Suite 160, San Diego, California has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""Temporary Order"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b) and chapter 255F, section 8(b).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  The Division, through the Commissioner, also has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons engaged in the business of a mortgage loan originator in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 2.  QuoteMatch is, and at all relevant times has been, a Massachusetts licensed mortgage broker doing business in the Commonwealth.  A. Failure to Obtain and Maintain a Surety Bond  Effective as of December 31, 2008, the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.06(2)(a) states, in part:  An Applicant [for a license as a mortgage broker] shall demonstrate and maintain: ... 2. a bond of $75,000 in such form and with such sureties as may be approved by the Commissioner. The surety bond must contain a clause that the insurance company will notify the Commissioner at least 30 days prior to canceling the surety bond for any reason. The Commissioner shall automatically suspend the license on the date the cancellation takes effect, unless the surety bond has been replaced or renewed.  The amendments to 209 CMR 42.06(2)(a) followed a public hearing held on July 10, 2007, by the Division for the purpose of affording all interested parties an opportunity to provide oral and written testimony regarding the proposed amendments to 209 CMR 42.00  et seq ., including the surety bond requirement. The public hearing was followed by a 10-day comment period which remained open until July 20, 2007.  Upon finalization of the amendments to 209 CMR 42.00  et seq ., the Division issued an Industry Letter dated September 10, 2007 and distributed to all lender and broker licensees at the time, providing advance notice to mortgage lenders and brokers of the substantial revisions to the Division's regulations, including the necessity to obtain the surety bond, stating, in part:  Any entity licensed on or before September 7th will be required to comply with the new net worth and surety bond requirements by December 31, 2008.…Conducting business without obtaining the surety bond is a violation of the above cited regulation. The Division considers failure to obtain said surety bond a serious violation.  The Division's Regulatory Bulletin 5.2-101: Bond Requirements for Licensed Mortgage Lenders and Mortgage Brokers, issued on January 24, 2008, states, in part:  Pursuant to the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.06(2)(a)(2), as a condition of obtaining and holding a mortgage broker license, a mortgage broker must establish and maintain a corporate surety bond of $75,000. The duration of the corporate surety bond must be continuous and shall be issued by a bonding company or insurance company authorized to do business in Massachusetts.  On or about October 30, 2008, the Division sent detailed instructions to all licensed mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders regarding the 2009 license renewal application process, which included the following directive: ""licensees must have executed surety bonds in place by December 31, 2008."" [Emphasis in original.]  On or about February 20, 2009, the Division sent additional information and instructions to all licensed mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders regarding the 2009 renewal application requirements. The instructions provided that licensees must mail the original notarized surety bond to the Division by March 31, 2009.  On or about April 30, 2009, the Division sent notices to all licensed mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders who had not filed the required surety bond with the Division. The April 30, 2009 notice provided such licensees with additional time to submit the required surety bond(s) and stated, in part, that:  [A]n original, notarized corporate surety bond . . .  must be  submitted to the Division by  Friday, May 15, 2009 . ... [T]he necessity to obtain the corporate surety bond is a requirement for  all  mortgage broker and mortgage lender licensees as a condition of maintaining the license, without exception. [Emphasis in original.]  As of the date of this Temporary Order, QuoteMatch has failed to file with the Division the required corporate surety bond.  B. Failure to Submit Financial Statements as Required  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.06(2)(b)3 states:  3. Renewal Applications. Within 90 days of the close of its fiscal year, an Applicant for [mortgage broker] license renewal shall submit financial statements for the preceding fiscal year that have been  audited or reviewed  by an independent certified public accountant and such other financial information as the Commissioner may require. [Emphasis supplied.]  On or about October 30, 2008, the Division sent detailed instructions to all licensed mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders regarding the 2009 license renewal application process.  The license renewal instructions notified each recipient that by December 31, 2008, all mortgage lender and mortgage broker licensees were required to establish compliance with 209 CMR 42.03 and 209 CMR 42.06, respectively, including the requirement to submit to the Division audited or reviewed financial statements, as determined by the type of license(s) held, within ninety (90) days of the end of a licensee's fiscal year end.  On or about February 20, 2009, the Division sent instructions to all licensed mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders regarding the 2009 license renewal requirements. Pursuant to the instructions contained therein, all licensed mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders with a fiscal year end date of December 31  st  were directed to file through the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System (NMLS) the required financial statements between March 9  th  and March 31, 2009. All licensed mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders with a fiscal year end date other than December 31  st  were directed to submit directly to the Division their financial statements prepared for the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2008.  As of the date of this Temporary Order, the Licensee has failed to file the required year-end financial statements.  C. Failure to Submit Annual Report  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8 states, in part:  Each licensee shall annually, on or before a date determined by the commissioner, file a report with the commissioner containing such information as said commissioner may require concerning the business and operations conducted by the licensee in the commonwealth during the preceding calendar year.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.10 states:  By March 31, each Licensee shall file an annual report with the Commissioner in such form as the Commissioner shall prescribe for the preceding calendar year. The annual report shall be in writing, subscribed by the Licensee under the pains and penalty of perjury.  The license renewal instructions issued by the Division on October 30, 2008 and February 20, 2009 as described above, also notified all licensed mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders of the requirement that all licensees were required to submit to the Division a completed Mortgage Lender/Mortgage Broker Annual Report for the period ending December 31, 2008 (""Mortgage Lender/Mortgage Broker 2008 Annual Report"") by March 31, 2009. In both sets of instructions, licensees were notified that a $50.00 per calendar day late fee would be assessed to all licensees that failed to submit the Mortgage Lender/Mortgage Broker 2008 Annual Report by March 31, 2009.  As of the date of this Temporary Order, the Licensee has failed to file a Mortgage Lender/Mortgage Broker 2008 Annual Report or to satisfy the associated late fee.  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 20, by failing to obtain and maintain a surety bond, QuoteMatch has violated 209 CMR 42.06(2)(a).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 20, by failing to file a surety bond with the Division on or before May 15, 2009, QuoteMatch has failed to satisfy the Division's filing requirements for licensed mortgage brokers which are a condition of holding the license(s) for the license period ending December 31, 2009.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 20, engaging in further activity under the mortgage license(s) without a surety bond, and in the absence of the intended protections of such bond for the consumers of the Commonwealth, would constitute the operation of the licensed business in a financially irresponsible manner in violation of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.06(2)(a)2.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 20, by failing to file the financial statements that are required pursuant to the license renewal process, QuoteMatch has violated 209 CMR 42.06(2)(b)3.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 20, by failing to file its Mortgage Lender/Mortgage Broker 2008 Annual Report, QuoteMatch has violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8 and 209 CMR 42.10.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 20, the Commissioner has determined that:  QuoteMatch has engaged in, is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that it is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage broker including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00 et seq.; and  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to QuoteMatch.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 20, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of QuoteMatch's original mortgage broker license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 20 present sufficient grounds for the revocation of QuoteMatch's mortgage broker license pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.04(2)(b), 42.07(2)(b).  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that QuoteMatch and any and all officers, members, managers, employees, independent contractors, or agents, operating on behalf of QuoteMatch, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of: (a) a mortgage broker, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, and (b) a mortgage loan originator, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 1, on behalf of QuoteMatch relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Temporary Order. Therefore, QuoteMatch is ordered to immediately cease soliciting or accepting, either directly or indirectly, any residential mortgage loan applications from consumers for residential property located in Massachusetts.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that QuoteMatch, shall immediately place any fees previously collected from Massachusetts consumers relative to any pending mortgage loan applications in a separate escrow account maintained at a federally insured bank.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that QuoteMatch shall immediately place with one or more qualified broker(s) or lender(s), as appropriate based on the status of the application and with no loss to applicants, all of its pending Massachusetts residential mortgage loan applications. QuoteMatch shall place such applications with a licensed Massachusetts broker(s) or lender(s), as appropriate, or with a financial institution(s) that is exempt from the mortgage licensing requirements under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that as soon as possible, but in no event later than two days after the effective date of this Temporary Order, QuoteMatch shall submit the following information in writing to the Commissioner:  A detailed record of all pending residential mortgage loan applications, which shall include, but is not limited to, the following: customer name, address, telephone number; all prepaid loan fees submitted by the customer; amount of loan; application status (i.e. filed, submitted to lenders); scheduled closing date; rate lock status; the location of all original open application files; and a list of applicable wholesale lenders. The latter list should include telephone numbers of contact persons familiar with QuoteMatch's submitted loans.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that QuoteMatch shall immediately secure all pending mortgage loan application files and, to the extent that any original documents must be forwarded to the relevant mortgage lender or mortgage broker pursuant to this Temporary Order, a copy of such document, correspondence, or paper relating to the mortgage loan shall be retained in QuoteMatch's books and records and shall be available to the Commissioner, in their entirety, immediately upon request on the date and time specified by the Commissioner.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that QuoteMatch shall submit a completed Mortgage Lender/Mortgage Broker 2008 Annual Report, in the form provided on the Division's website, and thereupon submit a payment to the Division of the amount then outstanding due to the late filing of the Mortgage Lender/Mortgage Broker 2008 Annual Report.  The amount of the late fee shall be determined in accordance with General Laws chapter 255E, section 8 by applying a rate of $50.00 per calendar day for each day after March 31, 2009 on which the Report remained outstanding. The Licensee may contact the Division to clarify or confirm the calculation of the late fee amount; and  QuoteMatch shall remit payment in accordance with this Paragraph of the Temporary Order for the amount then due, payable to the ""Commonwealth of Massachusetts,"" to the Office of the Commissioner of Banks, One South Station, 3  rd  Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02110.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Temporary Order shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless vacated, modified, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 30A.  It is understood that the Licensee may petition the Commissioner to vacate or modify this Temporary Order upon presenting to the Division satisfactory evidence that the Licensee has fully complied with the provisions of this Temporary Order and has obtained and filed with the Division the required surety bond(s) in accordance with the applicable regulations and regulatory bulletins.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such Temporary Order shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from QuoteMatch within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this Temporary Order. If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this Temporary Order shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.     BY ORDER AND DIRECTION OF THE COMMISSIONER OF BANKS.

The surety bond must contain a clause that the insurance company will notify the Commissioner at least 30 days prior to canceling the surety bond for any reason. The Commissioner shall automatically suspend the license on the date the cancellation takes effect, unless the surety bond has been replaced or renewed.  Effective as of December 31, 2008, the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.06(2)(a) states, in part:  An Applicant [for a license as a mortgage broker] shall demonstrate and maintain: ... 2. a bond of $75,000 in such form and with such sureties as may be approved by the Commissioner. The surety bond must contain a clause that the insurance company will notify the Commissioner at least 30 days prior to canceling the surety bond for any reason. The Commissioner shall automatically suspend the license on the date the cancellation takes effect, unless the surety bond has been replaced or renewed.  The amendments to 209 CMR 42.03(2)(a) and 209 CMR 42.06(2)(a) followed a public hearing held on July 10, 2007, by the Division for the purpose of affording all interested parties an opportunity to provide oral and written testimony regarding the proposed amendments to 209 CMR 42.00  et seq ., including the surety bond requirement. The public hearing was followed by a 10-day comment period which remained open until July 20, 2007.  Upon finalization of the amendments to 209 CMR 42.00  et seq ., the Division issued an Industry Letter dated September 10, 2007 and distributed to all lender and broker licensees at the time, providing advance notice to mortgage lenders and brokers of the substantial revisions to the Division's regulations, including the necessity to obtain the surety bond, stating, in part:  Any entity licensed on or before September 7th will be required to comply with the new net worth and surety bond requirements by December 31, 2008.…Conducting business without obtaining the surety bond is a violation of the above cited regulation. The Division considers failure to obtain said surety bond a serious violation.  The Division's Regulatory Bulletin 5.2-101: Bond Requirements for Licensed Mortgage Lenders and Mortgage Brokers, issued on January 24, 2008, states, in part:  Pursuant to the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.06(2)(a)(2), as a condition of obtaining and holding a mortgage broker license, a mortgage broker must establish and maintain a corporate surety bond of $75,000. The duration of the corporate surety bond must be continuous and shall be issued by a bonding company or insurance company authorized to do business in Massachusetts.  The Division's Regulatory Bulletin 5.2-101: Bond Requirements for Licensed Mortgage Lenders and Mortgage Brokers, issued on January 24, 2008, states, in part:  Pursuant to the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.03(2)(a)(2), as a condition of obtaining and holding a mortgage lender license, a mortgage lender must establish and maintain a corporate surety bond in a sum to be based on the volume of its mortgage loan business in Massachusetts, but in no event shall the sum of the corporate surety bond be less than $100,000, up to a maximum of $500,000. . . . The principal amount of the corporate surety bond shall be determined by the information reported by the licensee on the Mortgage Lender Annual Report for the preceding calendar year. The duration of the corporate surety bond must be continuous and shall be issued by a bonding company or insurance company authorized to do business in Massachusetts.  The Division's Regulatory Bulletin 5.2-101: Bond Requirements for Licensed Mortgage Lenders and Mortgage Brokers, issued on January 24, 2008, states, in part:  For clarification purposes, 209 CMR 42.03(2)(a)2 and 209 CMR 42.06(2)(a)2 set forth a corporate surety bond requirement for licensed mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers, respectively. Accordingly, any individual or entity which holds both a mortgage lender and a mortgage broker license will be required to maintain two corporate surety bonds as follows: (1) a mortgage lender surety bond for a principal amount determined in accordance with the provisions set forth in this regulatory bulletin and (2) a mortgage broker surety bond with a principal amount of $75,000.  On or about October 30, 2008, the Division sent detailed instructions to all licensed mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders regarding the 2009 license renewal application process, which included the following directive: ""licensees must have executed surety bonds in place by December 31, 2008."" [Emphasis in original.]  On or about February 20, 2009, the Division sent additional information and instructions to all licensed mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders regarding the 2009 renewal application requirements. The instructions provided that licensees must mail the original notarized surety bond to the Division by March 31, 2009.  On or about April 30, 2009, the Division sent notices to all licensed mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders who had not filed the required surety bond with the Division. The April 30, 2009 notice provided such licensees with additional time to submit the required surety bond(s) and stated, in part, that:  [A]n original, notarized corporate surety bond ...  must be  submitted to the Division by  Friday, May 15, 2009  . ... [T]he necessity to obtain the corporate surety bond is a requirement for  all  mortgage broker and mortgage lender licensees as a condition of maintaining the license, without exception. [Emphasis in original.]  On May 7, 2008, the Division received DBSA Holdings' mortgage lender corporate surety bond in the amount of $100,000.  As of the date of this Temporary Order, DBSA Holdings has failed to file with the Division the required mortgage broker corporate surety bond.  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 15, by failing to obtain and maintain a mortgage broker surety bond, DBSA Holdings has violated 209 CMR 209 CMR 42.06(2)(a).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 15, by failing to file a mortgage broker surety bond with the Division on or before May 15, 2009, DBSA Holdings has failed to satisfy the Division's filing requirements for licensed mortgage brokers which are a condition of holding the license(s) for the license period ending December 31, 2009.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 15, engaging in further activity under the mortgage broker license(s) without a surety bond, and in the absence of the intended protections of such bond for the consumers of the Commonwealth, would constitute the operation of the licensed business in a financially irresponsible manner in violation of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.06(2)(a)2.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 15, the Commissioner has determined that:  DBSA Holdings has engaged in, is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that it is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage broker including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00 et seq.; and  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to DBSA Holdings.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 15, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of DBSA Holdings' original mortgage broker license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 15 present sufficient grounds for the revocation of DBSA Holdings' mortgage broker licenses pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.07(2)(b).  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that DBSA Holdings and any and all officers, members, managers, employees, independent contractors, or agents, operating on behalf of DBSA Holdings, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of a mortgage broker, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Temporary Order. Therefore, DBSA Holdings is ordered to immediately cease negotiating, placing, assisting in placement, finding or offering to negotiate, place, assist in placement or find mortgage loans on residential property in Massachusetts.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that DBSA Holdings, shall immediately place any fees previously collected from Massachusetts consumers relative to any pending mortgage loan applications brokered by the Licensee in a separate escrow account maintained at a federally insured bank.

DBSA Holdings shall place such applications with a licensed Massachusetts broker(s) or lender(s), as appropriate, or with a financial institution(s) that is exempt from the mortgage licensing requirements under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that as soon as possible, but in no event later than two days after the effective date of this Temporary Order, DBSA Holdings shall submit the following information in writing to the Commissioner:  A detailed record of all pending residential mortgage loan applications for which DBSA Holdings is acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker, which shall include, but is not limited to, the following: customer name, address, telephone number; all prepaid loan fees submitted by the customer; amount of loan; application status (i.e. filed, submitted to lenders); scheduled closing date; rate lock status; the location of all original open application files; and a list of applicable wholesale lenders. The latter list should include telephone numbers of contact persons familiar with DBSA Holdings' submitted loans.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that DBSA Holdings shall immediately secure all pending mortgage loan application files and, to the extent that any original documents must be forwarded to the relevant mortgage lender or mortgage broker pursuant to this Temporary Order, a copy of such document, correspondence, or paper relating to the mortgage loan shall be retained in DBSA Holdings' books and records and shall be available to the Commissioner, in their entirety, immediately upon request on the date and time specified by the Commissioner.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Temporary Order shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless set vacated, modified, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 30A.  It being understood that the Licensee may petition the Commissioner to vacate or modify this Temporary Order upon presenting to the Division satisfactory evidence that the Licensee has fully complied with the provisions of this Temporary Order and has obtained and filed with the Division the required mortgage broker surety bond(s) in accordance with the applicable regulations and regulatory bulletins.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such Temporary Order shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from DBSA Holdings within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this Temporary Order. If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this Temporary Order shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.     BY ORDER AND DIRECTION OF THE COMMISSIONER OF BANKS.

196,11/9/2021,2009,Temporary Cease and Desist,"First Covenant Mortgage Co., Inc.",Mortgage Broker,illegally employed by two brokerage firms,"Woburn, MA",https://www.mass.gov/temporary-order-to-cease-and-desist/first-covenant-mortgage-co-inc," COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  Suffolk, SS.  COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE LENDER AND  MORTGAGE BROKER  LICENSING  Docket No. 2009-130  FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  FIRST COVENANT MORTGAGE CO., INC  Quincy, Massachusetts  Mortgage Broker License No. MB4815  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that First Covenant Mortgage Co., Inc. (""First Covenant"" or the ""Licensee""), with its main address located at 234 Copeland Street, Suite 230, Quincy, Massachusetts has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""Temporary Order"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b) and chapter 255F, section 8(b).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  The Division, through the Commissioner, also has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons engaged in the business of a mortgage loan originator in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 2.  First Covenant is, and at all relevant times has been, a Massachusetts licensed mortgage broker doing business in the Commonwealth. 	 Failure to Obtain and Maintain a Surety Bond  Effective as of December 31, 2008, the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.06(2)(a) states, in part: 	 An Applicant [for a license as a mortgage broker] shall demonstrate and maintain: . . . 2. a bond of $75,000 in such form and with such sureties as may be approved by the Commissioner. The surety bond must contain a clause that the insurance company will notify the Commissioner at least 30 days prior to canceling the surety bond for any reason. The Commissioner shall automatically suspend the license on the date the cancellation takes effect, unless the surety bond has been replaced or renewed.  The amendments to 209 CMR 42.06(2)(a) followed a public hearing held on July 10, 2007, by the Division for the purpose of affording all interested parties an opportunity to provide oral and written testimony regarding the proposed amendments to 209 CMR 42.00  et seq ., including the surety bond requirement. The public hearing was followed by a 10-day comment period which remained open until July 20, 2007.  Upon finalization of the amendments to 209 CMR 42.00  et seq ., the Division issued an Industry Letter dated September 10, 2007 and distributed to all lender and broker licensees at the time, providing advance notice to mortgage lenders and brokers of the substantial revisions to the Division's regulations, including the necessity to obtain the surety bond, stating, in part: 	 Any entity licensed on or before September 7th will be required to comply with the new net worth and surety bond requirements by December 31, 2008.…Conducting business without obtaining the surety bond is a violation of the above cited regulation. The Division considers failure to obtain said surety bond a serious violation.  The Division's Regulatory Bulletin 5.2-101: Bond Requirements for Licensed Mortgage Lenders and Mortgage Brokers, issued on January 24, 2008, states, in part: 	 Pursuant to the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.06(2)(a)(2), as a condition of obtaining and holding a mortgage broker license, a mortgage broker must establish and maintain a corporate surety bond of $75,000. The duration of the corporate surety bond must be continuous and shall be issued by a bonding company or insurance company authorized to do business in Massachusetts.  On or about October 30, 2008, the Division sent detailed instructions to all licensed mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders regarding the 2009 license renewal application process, which included the following directive: ""licensees must have executed surety bonds in place by December 31, 2008."" [Emphasis in original.]  On or about February 20, 2009, the Division sent additional information and instructions to all licensed mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders regarding the 2009 renewal application requirements. The instructions provided that licensees must mail the original notarized surety bond to the Division by March 31, 2009.  On or about April 30, 2009, the Division sent notices to all licensed mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders who had not filed the required surety bond with the Division. The April 30, 2009 notice provided such licensees with additional time to submit the required surety bond(s) and stated, in part, that: 	 [A]n original, notarized corporate surety bond . . .  must be  submitted to the Division by  Friday, May 15, 2009 . ... [T]he necessity to obtain the corporate surety bond is a requirement for  all  mortgage broker and mortgage lender licensees as a condition of maintaining the license, without exception. [Emphasis in original.]  On October 9, 2009, the Division sent First Covenant a Final Request Email requesting the mortgage broker bond be sent to the Division within ten (10) calendar days.  On March 2, 2009, the Division received a bond cancellation notice from Western Surety Company indicating that the mortgage broker bond would be cancelled on April 9, 2009. As of the date of this Temporary Order, First Covenant has failed to file with the Division the required corporate surety bond or bond reinstatement.  	  	 B. Failure to Submit Financial Statements as Required  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.06(2)(b)3 states: 	 3. Renewal Applications. Within 90 days of the close of its fiscal year, an Applicant for [mortgage broker] license renewal shall submit financial statements for the preceding fiscal year that have been  audited or reviewed  by an independent certified public accountant and such other financial information as the Commissioner may require. [Emphasis supplied.]  On or about October 30, 2008, the Division sent detailed instructions to all licensed mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders regarding the 2009 license renewal application process.  The license renewal instructions notified each recipient that by December 31, 2008, all mortgage lender and mortgage broker licensees were required to establish compliance with 209 CMR 42.03 and 209 CMR 42.06, respectively, including the requirement to submit to the Division audited or reviewed financial statements, as determined by the type of license(s) held, within ninety (90) days of the end of a licensee's fiscal year end.  On or about February 20, 2009, the Division sent instructions to all licensed mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders regarding the 2009 license renewal requirements. Pursuant to the instructions contained therein, all licensed mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders with a fiscal year end date of December 31  st  were directed to file through the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System (NMLS) the required financial statements between March 9  th  and March 31, 2009. All licensed mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders with a fiscal year end date other than December 31  st  were directed to submit directly to the Division their financial statements prepared for the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2008.  	  	 As of the date of this Temporary Order, the Licensee has failed to provide the required financial statements to fulfill the Division's license renewal requirements.  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 17, by failing to obtain and maintain a surety bond, First Covenant has violated 209 CMR 42.06(2)(a).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 17, by failing to file a surety bond with the Division on or before May 15, 2009, First Covenant has failed to satisfy the Division's filing requirements for licensed mortgage brokers which are a condition of holding the license(s) for the license period ending December 31, 2009.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 17, engaging in further activity under the mortgage license(s) without a surety bond, and in the absence of the intended protections of such bond for the consumers of the Commonwealth, would constitute the operation of the licensed business in a financially irresponsible manner in violation of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.06(2)(a)2.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 17, by failing to file the financial statements that are required pursuant to the license renewal process, First Covenant has violated 209 CMR 42.06(2)(b)3.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 17, the Commissioner has determined that: 	  (a) First Covenant has engaged in, is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that it is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage broker including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00 et seq.; and  (b) The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to First Covenant.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 17, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of First Covenant's original mortgage broker license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 17 present sufficient grounds for the revocation of First Covenant's mortgage broker license pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.04(2)(b), 42.07(2)(b).  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that First Covenant and any and all officers, members, managers, employees, independent contractors, or agents, operating on behalf of First Covenant, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of: (a) a mortgage broker, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, and (b) a mortgage loan originator, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 1, on behalf of First Covenant relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Temporary Order. Therefore, First Covenant is ordered to immediately cease soliciting or accepting, either directly or indirectly, any residential mortgage loan applications from consumers for residential property located in Massachusetts.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that First Covenant, shall immediately place any fees previously collected from Massachusetts consumers relative to any pending mortgage loan applications in a separate escrow account maintained at a federally insured bank.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that First Covenant shall immediately place with one or more qualified broker(s) or lender(s), as appropriate based on the status of the application and with no loss to applicants, all of its pending Massachusetts residential mortgage loan applications. First Covenant shall place such applications with a licensed Massachusetts broker(s) or lender(s), as appropriate, or with a financial institution(s) that is exempt from the mortgage licensing requirements under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that as soon as possible, but in no event later than two days after the effective date of this Temporary Order, First Covenant shall submit the following information in writing to the Commissioner: 	 (a) A detailed record of all pending residential mortgage loan applications, which shall include, but is not limited to, the following: customer name, address, telephone number; all prepaid loan fees submitted by the customer; amount of loan; application status (i.e. filed, submitted to lenders); scheduled closing date; rate lock status; the location of all original open application files; and a list of applicable wholesale lenders. The latter list should include telephone numbers of contact persons familiar with First Covenant's submitted loans.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that First Covenant shall immediately secure all pending mortgage loan application files and, to the extent that any original documents must be forwarded to the relevant mortgage lender or mortgage broker pursuant to this Temporary Order, a copy of such document, correspondence, or paper relating to the mortgage loan shall be retained in First Covenant's books and records and shall be available to the Commissioner, in their entirety, immediately upon request on the date and time specified by the Commissioner.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Temporary Order shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless vacated, modified, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 30A. 	 (a) It being understood that the Licensee may petition the Commissioner to vacate or modify this Temporary Order upon presenting to the Division satisfactory evidence that the Licensee has fully complied with the provisions of this Temporary Order and has obtained and filed with the Division the required surety bond(s) in accordance with the applicable regulations and regulatory bulletins.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such Temporary Order shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from First Covenant within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this Temporary Order. If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this Temporary Order shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.

200,11/12/2021,2009,Temporary Cease and Desist,John K. Richman,Mortgage Loan Originator,???,"Salem, NH",https://www.mass.gov/temporary-order-to-cease-and-desist/john-k-richman," COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  Suffolk, SS.  COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE LOAN  ORIGINATOR LICENSING  Docket No. 2009-128-MLO  FINDINGS OF FACT AND  TEMPORARY ORDER TO  CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  JOHN K. RICHMAN  Mortgage Loan Originator License No.: MLO19593  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that JOHN K. RICHMAN, has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 41.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""Temporary Order"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255F, section 8(b).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage loan originator in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 2 and its implementing regulation at 209 CMR 41.00  et seq .  The Division, through the Commissioner, also has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2 and its implementing regulation at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq .  John K. Richman is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage loan originator under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage loan originator license, license number MLO19593 to John K. Richman to engage in the business of a mortgage loan originator on or about July 17, 2008.  According to the Division's records, at all relevant times, John K. Richman was the Vice President and 50% owner of Union Capital Mortgage Business Trust (""Union Capital"" or the ""Corporation""). According to records maintained by the Division, John K. Richman identified himself as Vice President and ""control person"" of Union Capital.  Union Capital is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage lender and mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner issued a mortgage company license, license number MC2202 to Union Capital to engage in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker on or about August 9, 2002. License number MC2202 authorized Union Capital to conduct the mortgage company business from the Corporation's main office located at 1137 North Main Street, Randolph, Massachusetts.  Pursuant to General Laws chapter 255F, section 14, the Division is authorized to inspect the books, accounts, papers, records, and files of mortgage lenders, mortgage brokers and mortgage loan originators, respectively, transacting business in Massachusetts to determine compliance with the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, chapter 255F, and any rule, or regulation issued thereunder, and with any law, rule, or regulation applicable to the conduct of the licensed business.  Mortgage lenders who have made fifty or more home mortgage loans in the last calendar year are also subject to an evaluation of their community investment (""MLCI"") practices including a review of the mortgage lender's compliance with fair lending laws, compliance with the requirements of the Equal Opportunity Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, and the Predatory Home Loan Practices Act. Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8 further requires the Division to evaluate such mortgage lender's record of helping to meet the mortgage credit needs of the Commonwealth including low and moderate income neighborhoods and individuals.  On April 15, 2009, pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division commenced an MLCI examination of Union Capital to assess the Corporation's record of helping to meet the mortgage credit needs of the Commonwealth, including low to moderate income neighborhoods and individuals, consistent with the safe and sound operation of the mortgage lender. During the course of the MLCI examination, the Division's examiners became concerned with the sustainability of certain mortgage loans originated by Union Capital and those mortgage loans originated by John K. Richman. The Division's examiners reviewed multiple loan files originated by John K. Richman that exhibited patterns of early payment defaults, which resulted in the initiation of foreclosure actions for certain properties located in the Boston area.  On or about August 11, 2009, the Division expanded the scope of the MLCI examination by reviewing additional books and records maintained by the Corporation in response to the concerns raised during the MLCI examination.  The Division's MLCI Report of Examination (the ""Report""), which was issued to Union Capital on the effective date of this Temporary Order, presented the findings of the MLCI examination/inspection (""2009 examination/inspection"") and alleged significant failures to comply with applicable state and federal laws, rules, regulations, and regulatory bulletins governing the conduct of those engaged in the mortgage business in Massachusetts.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners revealed that certain information submitted by John K. Richman on behalf of Union Capital to investors during the origination of the mortgage loans, including but not limited to the occupancy status, and financial status of certain identified borrowers was false and/or misleading. John K. Richman was identified as the loan originator of record in several loan files reviewed as fully described in the Report and summarized as follows.  Unfair or Deceptive Acts and Practices  a. Deceptive Business Practices  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 41.09(1) states:  It is a prohibited act or practice for a Licensee to engage in conduct prohibited under 2  09 CMR 42.12A.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(8), states:  It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker of mortgage lender to falsify income or asset information on a mortgage loan application or mortgage loan documents.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) states:  Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 11(a) states:  Whenever the commissioner finds that any licensee has violated this chapter or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder, or any other law of the commonwealth applicable to the conduct of a mortgage loan originator on residential property in the commonwealth, the commissioner may, by order, in addition to any other action authorized under this chapter or any rule or regulation made thereunder, impose a penalty upon the person which shall not exceed $5,000 for each violation up to a maximum of $100,000 for such violation plus the costs of investigation. The commissioner may impose a penalty which shall not exceed $5,000 for each violation of this chapter, or any rule or regulation promulgated hereunder, by a person other than a licensee, plus the costs of investigation.  Books and records reviewed during the 2009 examination/inspection revealed that John K. Richman prepared and submitted 1003 Forms on behalf of Union Capital to lenders and/or investors, for multiple loan files in which the applicants' financial information including but not limited to applicants' income, assets, and/or employment information differed significantly and was not supported by the information reflected on other pertinent documentation which John K. Richman had in his possession as more fully described in the Report. Examples include but are not limited to the following:  (a) Borrower A Property Address: Stellman Road, Unit 3, Roslindale, MA Loan Originator: John K. Richman  A review of books and records maintained in the loan files provided by Union Capital to the Division's examiners and Registry of Deeds records indicate that certain information was misrepresented and omitted during the origination of the mortgage loan. The loan originator of record was John K. Richman.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners indicate that Borrower A purchased the Stellman Road property on or about March 21, 2007.  A Uniform Residential Loan Application (""1003 Form""), prepared by John K. Richman on behalf of Union Capital revealed that two mortgage loan obligations were omitted on the 1003 Form and not included in the calculation of the debt-to-income ratio. A copy of at least one mortgage statement for a property located on Whitfield Street, in Dorchester was maintained in the loan file. A Registry of Deeds search revealed that the borrower had purchased and mortgaged at least one other property on or about November 27, 2006. Neither mortgage payments were included in the debt-to-income ratio.  A review of the Corporation's books and records further revealed that the borrower had purchased and financed the Whitfield Street property through Union Capital on October 26, 2006, four months prior to the settlement of the Stellman Road property. The loan originator of record for the purchase of that property was John K. Richman.  The Division's examiner determined that the monthly payments for the mortgages on the four properties owned by Borrower A would be approximately $10,121 monthly or $121,452 annually including a miscellaneous debt reflected on the credit report reviewed by the Division's examiner. Had John K. Richman and Union Capital included all mortgage payments during the origination of the mortgage loan, the total debt-to-income ratio would have been 96%.  (b) Borrower B Property Address: Pond Street, Unit E12, Braintree, MA Loan Originator, John K. Richman  A 1003 Form prepared by John Richman on behalf of Union Capital for a loan which ultimately closed on September 19, 2007, indicated that the borrower, a graphic designer, earned approximately $7,311.05 monthly or $87,732.60 annually.  Paystubs maintained in the loan file reviewed by the Division's examiners revealed that borrower earned $2,500 bi-weekly or $5,416.67 monthly, aggregated to $65,000 annually.  The discrepancy between the information reflected on the 1003 Form, and the paystubs located in the loan file maintained by Union Capital revealed that the Corporation overstated the borrower's income by approximately $1,894.38 monthly or $22,732.56 annually.  (c) Borrower C Property Address: Highland, Unit 2 and Unit 3 Roxbury, MA Loan Originator, John K. Richman  A review of loan files maintained by Union Capital revealed that the certain information was misrepresented on mortgage loan documents prepared during the origination of the purchase of both Units of Highland Street. John K. Richman was noted as the loan originator of record for the purchase of both units.  Borrower C purchased both properties on May 9, 2007 with Union Capital as the lender of record and John K. Richman as the loan originator of record. The borrower was qualified for two mortgage loans on each property with a 100% Combined Loan to Value (""CLTV""). Both first mortgage loans for each property were submitted through two different investors, and each loan application signed by John K. Richman and submitted to the investors indicated that both units were to be the borrower's primary residence.  A review of the loan file for the purchase of Unit 3, revealed that the 1003 Form prepared by John K. Richman failed to include a reference to the proposed mortgage payment for Unit 2. The mortgage payment for Unit 2 also was not considered in the total obligations and debt-to-income ratio. The Division's examiner determined that had both payment obligations been included, the borrower would have had a total debt-to-income ratio of 94%.  A review of the Registry of Deeds records indicates that Unit 3 entered into foreclosure on March 5, 2009. Foreclosure proceedings on the Unit 2 were initiated on September 29, 2009.  b. Deceptive Business Practices: Misrepresentation of Occupancy Status  The commentary to section 226.2(a)(24) of the Federal Reserve System's Official Staff Commentary on Regulation Z, states in part: ""A consumer can only have one principal dwelling at a time.""  Loan documents, specifically the mortgage deeds identifying Union Capital as the lender of record in the loan files described below contain a provision that states the following:  Occupancy. Borrower shall occupy, establish, and use the property as the Borrower's principal residence within 60 days after the execution of this Security Instrument and shall continue to occupy the Property as Borrower's principal residence for at least one year after the date of occupancy, unless Lender otherwise agrees in writing, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, or unless extenuating circumstances exist which are beyond Borrower's control.  The Division's 2009 examination/inspection revealed that John K. Richman prepared 1003 Forms that concealed and/or misrepresented information relating to the occupancy status of multiple properties for which Union Capital sought residential mortgage loans on behalf of Massachusetts applicants. Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners revealed that John K. Richman, as the loan originator of record, prepared and submitted several purchase money 1003 Forms for multiple properties on behalf of an individual borrower, with each 1003 Form indicating that the subject property was to be used as the borrower's primary residence. Examples include but are not limited to the following:  (a) Borrower D: Property: Topliff Street, Dorchester, MA Property: Geneva Avenue, Unit 2, Dorchester, MA Loan Originator: John K. Richman  John K. Richman prepared loan documents on behalf of Union Capital for the purchase of two properties for Borrower D on or about April 25, 2007. The borrower applied for two mortgage loans for the purchase of each property with a CLTV of 100%. John K. Richman was the loan originator of record for all four transactions. Each mortgage loan was submitted to the investor with information indicating that the borrower would be occupying each property as their primary residence.  Borrower D purchased the Topliff Street property on May 4, 2007 and a review of documents provided by Union Capital to the Division's examiners indicate that the loan documents reflected that the property would be maintained as the borrower's primary residence.  Borrower D purchased the Geneva Avenue property on June 4, 2007 and a review of documents provided by Union Capital to the Division's examiners indicate that the property would be maintained as the borrower's primary residence.  A review of the documents in both loan files contained conflicting information.  A review of a Verification of Deposit (""VOD"") form maintained in the loan file for the purchase of Geneva Avenue was prepared on April 10, 2007 and indicated that the Borrower maintained a savings and checking account with balances of $8,934 and $22,291 respectively. The VOD indicated that both accounts were opened on March 27, 2004.  The VOD form maintained in the loan file for the purchase of Topliff Street was prepared by the same individual who prepared the Geneva Avenue VOD and was prepared as of May 20, 2007. The VOD indicated that the borrower maintained a savings and checking account and also held a certificate of deposit, with balances of $42,498, $9,934 and $95,000 respectively. The account numbers for the checking and savings account were the same as those reflected on the VOD for the purchase of the Geneva Avenue property. The VOD indicated that the checking and savings accounts were opened on January 27, 2000 and the certificate of deposit was opened on May 18, 2005.  Foreclosure proceedings were initiated on the Topliff Street property on or about July 30, 2008 and a foreclosure deed was recorded at the Registry of Deeds on January 20, 2009.  Foreclosure proceedings were initiated on the Geneva Avenue property on or about March 26, 2008 and a foreclosure deed was recorded at the Registry of Deeds on May 23, 2008.  (b) Borrower E: Property: D Street, Units 1 and 2 South Boston, MA Loan Originator: John K. Richman  John K. Richman originated two purchase money loans on behalf of Union Capital for the purchase of both Units 1 and 2 for a property located at D Street in South Boston, for Borrower E on December 26, 2006. The borrower applied and was qualified for two mortgage loans (100% CLTV). For the purchase of Unit 1, John K. Richman was the loan originator of record for the first mortgage loan on Unit 1 and Kalonji Franklin was the loan originator of record for the second mortgage loan on Unit 1. John Richman was the loan originator of record for the purchase of Unit 2. Union Capital was the lender of record for all transactions. Each mortgage loan was submitted to the investor with information indicating that the borrower would be occupying each property as their primary residence.  Registry of Deeds records indicated that Borrower E purchased Unit 1 on February 14, 2007 and a review of loan documents indicated that the property would be maintained as the borrower's primary residence.  Foreclosure proceedings were initiated on the first mortgage loan for Unit 1 on March 18, 2008 and a foreclosure deed was recorded on July 7, 2008.  Registry of Deeds records indicated that Borrower E purchased Unit 2 of the D Street property on February 27, 2007 and a review of loan documents indicated that the property would be maintained as the borrower's primary residence.  Foreclosure proceedings were initiated on Unit 2 on February 18, 2008 and a foreclosure deed was recorded on May 2, 2008.  John K. Richman, as a mortgage loan originator acting on behalf of Union Capital, should have known that information collected by the him as the mortgage loan originator of record, during the processing and/or underwriting of the mortgage loans would be relied upon by the mortgage lender, financial institution or investor to which the mortgage loans were brokered and/or sold by Union Capital.  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 20, John K. Richman has failed to demonstrate and maintain the character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that John K. Richman, as a licensed mortgage loan originator will act honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 4 and the Division's regulations 209 CMR 41.03(2)(b).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 20, by submitting misleading and/or inaccurate information to mortgage lenders, financial institutions or investors to whom Union Capital brokered and/or sold mortgage loans to, John K. Richman acting as a loan originator on behalf of Union Capital, has violated Division's regulation 209 CMR 41.09(1), and Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 20, by falsifying borrowers' income information on Uniform Residential Loan Applications submitted in connection with residential mortgage transactions, John K. Richman has violated the Division's regulation 209 CMR 41.09(1), and Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 20, by misrepresenting the occupancy status of multiple borrowers on mortgage loan documents submitted during the origination and processing of the residential mortgage transactions, John K. Richman has violated the Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) and the Office of the Attorney General's implementing regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 20, the Commissioner has determined that:  John K. Richman has engaged in, is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that it is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage loan originator including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 41.00 et seq.; and  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to John K. Richman.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 20, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of John K. Richman's original mortgage loan originator license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 20 present sufficient grounds for the revocation of John K. Richman's mortgage loan originator license pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 7 and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 41.04(2)(c)(1), 209 CMR 41.04(2)(c)(2) and 209 CMR 41.04(2)(c)(3).  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that John K. Richman shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of a mortgage loan originator, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Temporary Order. Therefore, John K. Richman is ordered to immediately cease soliciting or accepting, either directly or indirectly, any residential mortgage loan applications from consumers for residential property located in Massachusetts.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Temporary Order shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 30A.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Temporary Order shall not be construed as approving any act, practice, or conduct not specifically set forth herein which was, is, or may be in violation of relevant state or federal laws and regulations.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such Temporary Order shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from John K. Richman within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this Temporary Order. If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this Temporary Order shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE BROKER AND  LENDER LICENSING  Docket No. 2009-125  ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE  AND NOTICE OF RIGHT  TO A HEARING  In the Matter of  MORTGAGE SECURITY, INC.  East Falmouth, Massachusetts  Mortgage Company License No. MC0490  ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLAINT  The Commonwealth of Massachusetts Division of Banks (the ""Division""), by and through the Commissioner of Banks of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the ""Commissioner  "") , for its Order to Show Cause and Notice of Right to a Hearing (""Order and Notice""), alleges as follows:  The Division brings this action under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 to obtain temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief, ordering Mortgage Security, Inc. (""Mortgage Security"" or the ""Corporation""), at all relevant times, a licensed mortgage lender and mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2 and its implementing regulation 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , to cease and desist from transacting business in the Commonwealth as a mortgage lender and mortgage broker; revocation of Mortgage Security's Massachusetts mortgage company license MC0490; and such other equitable relief as may be necessary due to Mortgage Security's failure to maintain and exercise the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that its business will be operated honestly, fairly, soundly, and efficiently in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulations 209 CMR 42.03(2)(c) and 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).  JURISDICTION AND VENUE  The Division is an agency of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts with jurisdiction over matters relating to the licensing and regulation of those engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2 and Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8.  At all relevant times, Mortgage Security has been engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker of residential property in Massachusetts.  RESPONDENTS  Mortgage Security is, and at relevant times has been, a corporation conducting business in the Commonwealth with its main office located at 31 Teaticket Highway, East Falmouth, Massachusetts.  Mortgage Security is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage lender and mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage company license, license number MC0490, to Mortgage Security to engage in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker on or about October 28, 1993. At all relevant times Robert Pena has been President and sole officer/director of the Corporation.  REGULATORY BACKGROUND  Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division is authorized to inspect the books, accounts, papers, records, and files of mortgage brokers transacting business in Massachusetts to determine compliance with the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E and any rule, or regulation issued thereunder, and with any law, rule, or regulation applicable to the conduct of the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker.  On July 21, 2008, pursuant to the authority granted under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division commenced an examination/inspection of the books, accounts, papers, records, and files maintained by Mortgage Security to evaluate the Corporation's compliance with the laws, regulations, and regulatory bulletins applicable to the conduct of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker business in Massachusetts (the ""examination/inspection"").  On or about October 10, 2009, the Division became aware that Mortgage Security had no licensed mortgage loan originators sponsored by the Corporation and, therefore, should not be conducting mortgage business in Massachusetts. The Division thereafter conducted a visitation of Mortgage Security on or about October 8, 2009 to ascertain whether the Corporation was still conducting mortgage broker and/or lender activity in Massachusetts.  The Division's Report of Examination/Inspection (the ""Report""), was issued to Mortgage Security on the effective date of this Order and Notice and alleged significant failures to comply with applicable state and federal laws, rules, regulations, and regulatory bulletins governing the conduct of those engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts. The findings and conclusions of the Report are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference.  A. Conducting Residential Mortgage Loan Business in Massachusetts with Unlicensed Mortgage Loan Originators  Effective July 31, 2009, M.G.L. chapter 255F, section 2(a), states, in part (Effective July 1, 2008 until July 31, 2009, M.G.L. chapter 255F, section 2 stated: ""No person shall act as a mortgage loan originator unless such person has first obtained a mortgage loan originator license from the commissioner. An entity shall not knowingly employ or retain a mortgage loan originator unless the mortgage loan originator is licensed under this chapter.""):  No individual shall act as a mortgage loan originator with respect to any dwelling unless such person has first obtained a mortgage loan originator license from the commissioner or is exempt from the licensure requirement ... No person shall knowingly employ or retain a mortgage loan originator unless the mortgage loan originator is licensed under this chapter or is exempt from the licensure requirement.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(17) states:  It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker or a mortgage lender to conduct business with an individual who should be licensed as a mortgage loan originator under M.G.L. c. 255F, and who the mortgage broker or mortgage lender knows or should know is an unlicensed mortgage loan originator.  According to the Division's records, Robert Pena was authorized to originate residential mortgage loans on behalf of Mortgage Security from May 27, 2008, the date he applied for a mortgage loan originator license as a ""grandfathered"" (Chapter 206 of the Acts of 2007 which added Chapter 255F to the General Laws of Massachusetts introduced the license requirement for individuals engaged in the activity of a ""mortgage loan originator"" and grandfathered existing loan originators for an 180 day period, beginning on November 29, 2007 and ending on May 27, 2008. Therefore, grandfathered individuals who filed applications on or before May 27, 2008 were permitted to originate mortgage loans while their license applications remained in a pending status.); individual, until October 28, 2008 when his application status was updated to ""withdrawn - application abandoned"" as a result of his failure to submit all information that was required by the Division to complete his license application.  According to the Division's records, Wesley Pena, an employee of Mortgage Security, was authorized to originate residential mortgage loans on behalf of Mortgage Security from May 27, 2008, the date he applied for a mortgage loan originator license as a ""grandfathered"" individual, until March 6, 2009 when he voluntarily withdrew his application.  According to the Division's records and as described above, it appears that Mortgage Security did not have any licensed mortgage loan originators employed by or sponsored by the Corporation from March 7, 2009 through July 13, 2009.  According to the Division's records, Mario B. Inganni, a licensed mortgage loan originator in Massachusetts, was working for and sponsored by Mortgage Security and, therefore, authorized to originate mortgage loans on behalf of Mortgage Security from July 14, 2009 until September 21, 2009.  According to the Division's records and as described above, it appears that Mortgage Security has not had any licensed mortgage loan originators associated with the Corporation since September 21, 2009.  On or about October 8, 2009, the Division's examiners requested a detailed list of closed loans originated by Mortgage Security to assess the Corporation's mortgage loan origination activity. During the week of October 12, 2009, Mortgage Security provided several closed loan lists with a total of 43 residential mortgage originations since November 1, 2008. The lists did not include the name of the loan originator(s) responsible for each loan.  According to the loan lists provided by Mortgage Security, 14 residential mortgage loans were originated by the Corporation between March 7, 2009 and July 13, 2009, the time period during which it appeared Mortgage Security had no licensed mortgage loan originators associated with it. The Division's examiners generated a ""Sponsored Individual Roster"" report on the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System (NMLS) for each day between March 7, 2009 and July 13, 2009 on which a mortgage loan was originated by Mortgage Security to determine if the Corporation had associated with it any sponsored mortgage loan originators on that particular day. The reports confirm that Mortgage Security did not have any licensed mortgage loan originators sponsored by the Corporation on those days that the aforementioned 14 residential mortgage loans were originated. Therefore, the loans were originated on behalf of Mortgage Security by unlicensed mortgage loan originator(s).  B. Failure to Properly Maintain Books and Records  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.09(1) states:  Each Licensee shall keep and use its books, records and accounts in a manner which will allow the Commissioner to determine whether the Licensee is complying with the provisions of M.G.L. c.255E and applicable state and federal laws and regulations. Each Licensee shall comply with the provisions of 209 CMR 48.00... (b) The mortgage broker ... shall retain for a minimum of three years after a mortgage loan is made the following: the original loan origination and compensation agreement as set out in 209 CMR 42.16; a copy of the settlement statement; an account of fees received in connection with the loan; correspondence; papers or records relating to the loan; and such other documents as the Commissioner may require.  Mortgage Security was unable to produce a complete list of loans originated by the Corporation during the previous three years, as requested by the Division's examiners during the examination/inspection. Moreover, the examination/inspection revealed that Mortgage Security failed to maintain any sort of organized record retention and filing system that would allow for the ease of access to the Corporation's books and records; nor did the Corporation utilize an electronic tracking system.  Because of the disorganization of the Mortgage Security's loan files, the Corporation could not provide the Division's examiners with a representative sample of the Corporation's loans for the examiners' review. As a result, the Division's examiners obtained the loan sample required to conduct the examination/inspection by gathering and sorting all loan files that were available throughout Mortgage Security's office.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the examination/inspection indicated that Mortgage Security failed to retain sufficient documentation to enable the Division's examiners to determine whether the Corporation was complying with the provisions of M.G.L. c.255E and applicable state and federal laws and regulations, in violation of 209 CMR 42.09(1). Specifically, the Corporation engaged in a pattern or practice of failing to retain copies of credit reports, appraisals, underwriting conditions, employment verification documentation, closing documents, and/or required disclosure forms, as further described in the Report.  C. Failure to Timely File Required Reports  M.G.L. chapter 255E, section 8 states, in part:  Each licensee shall annually, on or before a date determined by the commissioner, file a report with the commissioner containing such information as said commissioner may require concerning the business and operations conducted by the licensee in the commonwealth during the preceding calendar year. A licensee neglecting to file such report or failing to amend the same within fifteen days of notice from said commissioner directing the same shall, unless such neglect or failure is due to justifiable cause and not due to wilful [sic] neglect, pay to the commonwealth fifty dollars for each day during which such neglect or failure continues.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.10 states, in part:  By March 31, each Licensee shall file an annual report with the Commissioner in such form as the Commissioner shall prescribe for the preceding calendar year.  Mortgage Security was reminded of the March 31, 2009 due date for the 2008 Mortgage Lender and/or Mortgage Broker Annual Report to the Division (""Annual Report"") in the Division's 2008 License Renewal Instructions which were included in October 30, 2008 correspondence that the Division issued to all licensed mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers. The License Renewal Instructions were also posted on the Division's website as of October 30  th . Mortgage Security was also notified of the Annual Report due date and late charge by a notice dated February 20, 2009.  The Division did not receive Mortgage Security, Inc.'s Annual Report until August 14, 2009. Accordingly, by letter to Mortgage Security dated August 14, 2009, the Division requested that the Corporation remit payment in the amount of $6,800.00 to satisfy the annual report late fee, which was calculated at a rate of $50 per calendar day that the Annual Report remained outstanding.  On September 10, 2009, the Division entered a deficiency license item on Mortgage Security's Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System (NMLS) record requiring that the Corporation remit the fee, as stated in the Division's letter of August 14, 2009. The entering of such deficiency on the Corporation's NMLS record would automatically generate an email notification to the Corporation's e-mail address of record.  On or about October 15, 2009, Mortgage Security submitted the required Annual Report late fee.  D. Unearned fee  The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, (""RESPA"") implementing regulation, 24 CFR 3500.14(c) states, in part:  No person shall give and no person shall accept any portion, split, or percentage of any charge made or received for the rendering of a settlement service in connection with a transaction involving a federally related mortgage loan other than for services actually performed. A charge by a person for which no or nominal services are performed or for which duplicative fees are charged is an unearned fee and violates this section.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the examination/inspection indicate that Mortgage Security charged a consumer an ""escrow waiver fee"" for which no service was rendered by Mortgage Security.  E. Loan Origination and Compensation Agreement  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(5) states, in part:  It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker to fail to provide to the consumer at the time of application the loan origination and compensation agreement required under 209 CMR 42.16. The content of the agreement shall strictly conform to 209 CMR 42.16 and include signatures and dates by the consumer(s) and the mortgage broker.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.09(1)(b) states, in part:  Each mortgage broker ... shall retain for a minimum of three years after a mortgage loan is made the following: the original loan origination and compensation agreement as set out in 209 CMR 42.16.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the examination/inspection revealed that Mortgage Security routinely failed to retain evidence of having provided the Loan Origination and Compensation Agreements. This deficiency was observed in all of the loan files reviewed.  F. Providing Mortgage Lender Disclosures to Consumers When Acting in the Capacity of a Mortgage Broker  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the examination/inspection indicate that Mortgage Security routinely provided ""Right to Copy of Appraisal"" forms to consumers, thus exceeding its authority as a mortgage broker, as further described in the Report.  G. Failure to Provide Required Disclosures  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(12) states:  It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker or mortgage lender to engage in a pattern or practice of failing to make any disclosure to a consumer required by and at the time specified by any applicable state or federal law, regulation or directive.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the examination/inspection revealed that Mortgage Security failed to retain evidence of having provided applicants with the credit score disclosure required under Section 609(g) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 [15 U.S.C. § 1681g(g)]. This practice was observed in all loan files reviewed during the examination/inspection.  H. Failure to Include Mortgage Loan Originator Information on Residential Mortgages Filed in Massachusetts  Effective November 29, 2007, M.G.L. c. 183, Section 6D states:  Every mortgage and assignment of mortgage secured by residential property, as defined in section 1 of chapter 255E, presented for record, in which a mortgage broker, as defined in said section 1 of said chapter 255E, is involved shall contain or have endorsed upon it the name, post office address and license number of the mortgage broker and, if applicable, the mortgage loan originator, as defined in section 1 of chapter 255F, responsible for placing the mortgage loan with the mortgagee. This endorsement, or notation that no mortgage broker or mortgage loan originator was involved in the mortgage, if known, shall be recorded as part of the mortgage or assignment of mortgage. Failure to comply with this section shall not affect the validity of any mortgage or the recording of any mortgage or assignment of mortgage.  The Division's examiners conducted a review of mortgage deeds recorded at the Barnstable Registry of Deeds through  www.masslandrecords.com  and determined that, in all records reviewed on which Mortgage Security was listed as the lender of record, Mortgage Security failed to include the name, address, and license number of the mortgage loan originator responsible for originating the loan on behalf of the Corporation.  I. Other Violations  In addition to the violations specifically set forth in this Order and Notice, The Report, to be provided to Mortgage Security in conjunction with the issuance of this Order and Notice, describes other violations and areas of concern observed during the examination/inspection.  VIOLATIONS  NOW, THEREFORE, the Division hereby sets forth the following Charges against Mortgage Security:  The Division hereby re-alleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 39 of this Order and Notice as though fully set forth.  CHARGE ONE:  Mortgage Security has failed to demonstrate the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulations 209 CMR 42.03(2)(c) and 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).  CHARGE TWO : By engaging in residential mortgage business with unlicensed individuals who should be licenses as mortgage loan originators under M.G.L. chapter 255F, Mortgage Security has violated M.G.L, chapter 255F, section 2(a) and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(17).  CHARGE THREE:  By failing to keep and use its books, records and accounts in a manner which would allow the Commissioner to determine whether the Corporation is complying with the provisions of M.G.L. c. 255E and applicable state and federal laws and regulations, Mortgage Security has violated the Division's regulation 209 CMR 209 42.09(1).  CHARGE FOUR : By filing its Annual Report after the deadline, Mortgage Security violated M.G.L. chapter 255E, section 8 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.10.

CHARGE TEN : Had the foregoing existed at the time of Mortgage Security's original mortgage lender and mortgage broker license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such licenses.

202,11/12/2021,2009,Temporary Cease and Desist,James Edward Hirbour,Mortgage Loan Originator,???,"Danvers, MA",https://www.mass.gov/temporary-order-to-cease-and-desist/james-edward-hirbour," COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  Suffolk, SS.  COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE LOAN  ORIGINATOR LICENSING  Docket No. 2009-132-MLO  FINDINGS OF FACT AND  TEMPORARY ORDER TO  CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  JAMES EDWARD HIRBOUR  Mortgage Loan Originator License No.: MLO19618  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that JAMES EDWARD HIRBOUR, has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 41.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""Temporary Order"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255F, section 8(b).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage loan originator in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 2 and its implementing regulation at 209 CMR 41.00  et seq .  The Division, through the Commissioner, also has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2 and its implementing regulation at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq .  James Edward Hirbour is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage loan originator under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage loan originator license, license number MLO19618 to James Edward Hirbour to engage in the business of a mortgage loan originator on or about October 31, 2008.  Books and records reviewed indicate that, at all relevant times, James Edward Hirbour was employed as branch manager and loan originator by Union Capital Mortgage Business Trust (""Union Capital"" or the ""Corporation"").  Union Capital is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage lender and mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner issued a mortgage company license, license number MC2202 to Union Capital to engage in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker on or about August 9, 2002. License number MC2202 authorized Union Capital to conduct the mortgage company business from the Corporation's main office located at 1137 North Main Street, Randolph, Massachusetts.  Pursuant to General Laws chapter 255F, section 14, the Division is authorized to inspect the books, accounts, papers, records, and files of mortgage lenders, mortgage brokers and mortgage loan originators, respectively, transacting business in Massachusetts to determine compliance with the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, chapter 255F, and any rule, or regulation issued thereunder, and with any law, rule, or regulation applicable to the conduct of the licensed business.  Mortgage lenders who have made fifty or more home mortgage loans in the last calendar year are also subject to an evaluation of their community investment (""MLCI"") practices including a review of the mortgage lender's compliance with fair lending laws, compliance with the requirements of the Equal Opportunity Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, and the Predatory Home Loan Practices Act. Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8 further requires the Division to evaluate such mortgage lender's record of helping to meet the mortgage credit needs of the Commonwealth including low and moderate income neighborhoods and individuals.  On April 15, 2009, pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division commenced an MLCI examination of Union Capital to assess the Corporation's record of helping to meet the mortgage credit needs of the Commonwealth, including low to moderate income neighborhoods and individuals, consistent with the safe and sound operation of the mortgage lender. During the course of the MLCI examination, the Division's examiners became concerned with the suitability and sustainability of certain mortgage loans originated by Union Capital and those mortgage loans originated by James Edward Hirbour. On or about August 11, 2009, the Division expanded the scope of the MLCI examination by reviewing additional books and records maintained by the Corporation in response to the concerns raised during the MLCI examination.  The Division's MLCI Report of Examination (the ""Report""), which was issued to Union Capital on the effective date of this Temporary Order, presented the findings of the MLCI examination/inspection (""2009 examination/inspection"") and alleged significant failures to comply with applicable state and federal laws, rules, regulations, and regulatory bulletins governing the conduct of those engaged in the mortgage business in Massachusetts.  Books and Records reviewed by the Division's examiners revealed that multiple loan files originated by James Edward Hirbour while employed at Union Capital contained certain information including but not limited to the occupancy status, and financial status of certain identified borrowers that was false and/or misleading as fully described in the Report and summarized below.  Unfair or Deceptive Acts and Practices  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 41.09(1) states:  It is a prohibited act or practice for a Licensee to engage in conduct prohibited under 2  09 CMR 42.12A .  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(8), states:  It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker of mortgage lender to falsify income or asset information on a mortgage loan application or mortgage loan documents.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) states:  Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 11(a) states;  Whenever the commissioner finds that any licensee has violated this chapter or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder, or any other law of the commonwealth applicable to the conduct of a mortgage loan originator on residential property in the commonwealth, the commissioner may, by order, in addition to any other action authorized under this chapter or any rule or regulation made thereunder, impose a penalty upon the person which shall not exceed $5,000 for each violation up to a maximum of $100,000 for such violation plus the costs of investigation. The commissioner may impose a penalty which shall not exceed $5,000 for each violation of this chapter, or any rule or regulation promulgated hereunder, by a person other than a licensee, plus the costs of investigation.  The commentary to section 226.2(a)(24) of the Federal Reserve System's Official Staff Commentary on Regulation Z, states in part: ""A consumer can only have one principal dwelling at a time.""  Loan documents, specifically the mortgage deeds identifying Union Capital as the lender of record in the loan files described below contain a provision that states the following:  Occupancy. Borrower shall occupy, establish, and use the property as the Borrower's principal residence within 60 days after the execution of this Security Instrument and shall continue to occupy the Property as Borrower's principal residence for at least one year after the date of occupancy, unless Lender otherwise agrees in writing, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, or unless extenuating circumstances exist which are beyond Borrower's control.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2009 examination/inspection revealed that that certain information including the occupancy status of the property was concealed and/or misrepresented to investors. James Edward Hirbour was noted as the mortgage loan originator in loan files reviewed by the Division's examiners.  Books and records reviewed during the 2009 examination/inspection revealed that James Edward Hirbour prepared and submitted 1003 Forms on behalf of Union Capital to lenders and/or investors, in which the applicants' financial information including but not limited to applicants' income and/or assets, differed significantly and was not supported by the information reflected on other pertinent documentation which James Edward Hirbour had in his possession as more fully described in the Report. Examples include but are not limited to the following:  a. Deceptive Business Practices  (a) Borrower A:  	   Property: Loring Avenue, Salem, MA Property: Salem Street, Salem, MA Loan Originator: James Edward Hirbour  James Edward Hirbour originated two mortgage loans for two properties for Borrower A, within a period of approximately eight days. Union Capital was the lender of record in all transactions. Each mortgage loan was submitted to the investor with information indicating that the borrower would be occupying each property as their primary residence.  Books and records provided to the Division's examiners for review indicate that the Uniform Residential Loan Application (""1003 Form"") was prepared by James Edward Hirbour on behalf Union Capital on December 13, 2006 for the refinance of the Loring Avenue property. Borrower A refinanced the Loring Avenue property on January 26, 2007 and a review of documents provided by Union Capital to the Division's examiners indicate that the loan documents reflected that the property would be maintained as the borrower's primary residence.  Books and records provided to the Division's examiners for review indicate that the 1003 Form was prepared by James Edward Hirbour on January 3, 2007 for the purchase of the Salem Street property. Borrower E purchased the Salem Street property on January 31, 2007 and a review of documents provided by Union Capital to the Division's examiners indicate that the property would be maintained as the borrower's primary residence.  A review of the documents maintained in both loan files maintained by Union Capital and provided to the Division for review reflected certain information that appeared to be misleading.  A review of loan documents maintained in the Loring Avenue loan file revealed that the Corporation maintained approximately three copies of a 1003 Form prepared by James Edward Hirbour and each copy reflected different salary amounts.  A copy of a signed 1003 Form reflected a monthly salary of $5,824.50 monthly or $69,894 annually.  A copy of an unsigned 1003 Form reflected a monthly salary of $8,345 monthly or $100,140 annually.  A copy of an unsigned 1003 Form reflected a monthly salary of $8,395 monthly or $100,740 annually.  A review of loan documents maintained in the Salem Street loan file, including but not limited to underwriting determinations by a national lender, a copy of a credit report and a copy of an appraisal indicate that the borrower had applied for a mortgage loan for the purchase of the Salem Street property prior to the January 3, 2007 date. The underwriting determination letter from a national lender was dated December 13, 2006, the same date as the application date for the refinance of the Loring Avenue property, additionally the credit report was dated December 8, 2006 and the appraisal was dated December 26, 2006.  A copy of an initial underwriting determination maintained in the Salem Street loan file indicted that the borrower had initially applied for a 30 year fixed rate loan, however, the underwriting determination form maintained in the loan file stated the following ""DTI was pending-currently exceeding max of 50% at 62.11%."" Subsequent underwriting determination sheets indicate that the program was subsequently changed to a 40 year reduced documentation loan program.  The 1003 Form maintained in the loan file provided by Union Capital to the Division's examiners did not reflect the Loring Street property as a property owned by the borrower in the real estate owned section of the 1003 Form. Additionally, the Corporation further indicated that the borrower was occupying the property ""rent free"".  A review of public records and Registry of Deeds records indicate that foreclosure proceedings were initiated on the Loring Avenue property on August 12, 2009 and foreclosure proceedings were initiated on the Salem Street property on February 29, 2009.  (b) Borrower B:  Property: Tyler Street, Malden, MA Loan Originator: James Edward Hirbour  James Edward Hirbour prepared loan documents on behalf of Union Capital for the refinance of the Tyler Street property for a settlement that occurred on February 20, 2007. The borrower applied for two mortgage loans for the refinance with a 100% Combined Loan to Value (""CLTV""). James Edward Hirbour was the loan originator of record for both transactions.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiner indicate that the income reflected on two 1003 Forms maintained in the loan file were inconsistent.  A review of one 1003 Form maintained in the loan file indicated that the borrower was employed as a Sales Associate at an automobile dealership, earning a gross monthly income of $8,496, or $101,952 annually.  The Division's examiners confirmed with documents reviewed from the end investor that the information reflected on the 1003 Form was utilized for qualification and submitted to the investor to whom the mortgage loan was sold by Union Capital.  The loan file reviewed by the examiner also contained a partial copy of the 1003 Form, specifically the income/employment page of a 1003 Form which was initialed by the borrower. The 1003 Form reflected the borrower's gross monthly income as $7,986, or $95,832 annually.  The difference in income between the income reflected on the information submitted to the end investor and the 1003 Form maintained in the loan file was approximately $510 monthly or $6,120 annually.  Foreclosure proceedings were initiated on the Tyler Street property on or about December 20, 2007, ten months after the refinance transaction.  A further review by the Division's examiners revealed that the property was sold for $278,000 on or about July 21, 2008. Information provided to the Division's examiners revealed that the property was sold as a result of a short sale approved by the end investor.  James Edward Hirbour, as a loan originator on behalf of Union Capital, should have known that information collected by the him as the mortgage loan originator of record, during the processing and/or underwriting of the mortgage loans would be relied upon by the mortgage lender, financial institution or investor to which the mortgage loans were brokered and/or sold by Union Capital.  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 19, James Edward Hirbour has failed to demonstrate and maintain the character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that James Edward Hirbour, as a licensed mortgage loan originator will act honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 41.03(2)(b).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 19, by submitting misleading and/or inaccurate information to mortgage lenders, financial institutions or investors to whom Union Capital brokered and/or sold mortgage loans to, James Edward Hirbour, has violated Division's regulation 209 CMR 41.09(1) and Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 19, by falsifying borrowers' income information on Uniform Residential Loan Applications submitted in connection with residential mortgage transactions, James Edward Hirbour has violated the Division's regulation 209 CMR 41.09(1) and Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 19, by misrepresenting the occupancy status on mortgage loan documents submitted during the origination and processing of the residential mortgage transactions, James Edward Hirbour has violated the Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) and the Office of the Attorney General's implementing regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 19, the Commissioner has determined that:  James Edward Hirbour has engaged in, is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that it is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage loan originator including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 41.00 et seq.; and  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to James Edward Hirbour.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 19, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of James Edward Hirbour's original mortgage loan originator license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 19 present sufficient grounds for the revocation of James Edward Hirbour's mortgage loan originator license pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 7 and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 41.04(2)(c)(1), 209 CMR 41.04(2)(c)(2) and 209 CMR 41.04(2)(c)(3).  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that James Edward Hirbour shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of a mortgage loan originator, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Temporary Order. Therefore, James Edward Hirbour is ordered to immediately cease soliciting or accepting, either directly or indirectly, any residential mortgage loan applications from consumers for residential property located in Massachusetts.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Temporary Order shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 30A.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Temporary Order shall not be construed as approving any act, practice, or conduct not specifically set forth herein which was, is, or may be in violation of relevant state or federal laws and regulations.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such Temporary Order shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from James Edward Hirbour within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this Temporary Order. If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this Temporary Order shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE LOAN  ORIGINATOR LICENSING  Docket No. 2009-131-MLO  FINDINGS OF FACT AND  TEMPORARY ORDER TO  CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  KALONJI D. FRANKLIN  Mortgage Loan Originator License No.: MLO25380  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that KALONJI D. FRANKLIN., has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 41.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""Temporary Order"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255F, section 8(b).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage loan originator in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 2 and its implementing regulation at 209 CMR 41.00  et seq.  The Division, through the Commissioner, also has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2 and its implementing regulation at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq .  Kalonji D. Franklin is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage loan originator under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage loan originator license, license number MLO25380 to Kalonji D. Franklin to engage in the business of a mortgage loan originator on or about July 10, 2008. The Division's records indicate that Kalonji D. Franklin is currently in an ""approved-inactive"" status as reflected on the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System (""NMLS"").  Books and records reviewed indicate that, at all relevant times, Kalonji D. Franklin was employed as an underwriter by Union Capital Mortgage Business Trust (""Union Capital"" or the ""Corporation"").  Union Capital is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage lender and mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner issued a mortgage company license, license number MC2202 to Union Capital to engage in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker on or about August 9, 2002. License number MC2202 authorized Union Capital to conduct the mortgage company business from the Corporation's main office located at 1137 North Main Street, Randolph, Massachusetts.  Pursuant to General Laws chapter 255F, section 14, the Division is authorized to inspect the books, accounts, papers, records, and files of mortgage lenders, mortgage brokers and mortgage loan originators, respectively, transacting business in Massachusetts to determine compliance with the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, chapter 255F, and any rule, or regulation issued thereunder, and with any law, rule, or regulation applicable to the conduct of the licensed business.  Mortgage lenders who have made fifty or more home mortgage loans in the last calendar year are also subject to an evaluation of their community investment (""MLCI"") practices including a review of the mortgage lender's compliance with fair lending laws, compliance with the requirements of the Equal Opportunity Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, and the Predatory Home Loan Practices Act. Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8 further requires the Division to evaluate such mortgage lender's record of helping to meet the mortgage credit needs of the Commonwealth including low and moderate income neighborhoods and individuals.  On April 15, 2009, pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division commenced an MLCI examination of Union Capital to assess the Corporation's record of helping to meet the mortgage credit needs of the Commonwealth, including low to moderate income neighborhoods and individuals, consistent with the safe and sound operation of the mortgage lender. During the course of the MLCI examination, the Division's examiners became concerned with the sustainability of certain mortgage loans brokered and /or sold to investors by Union Capital.  On or about August 11, 2009, the Division expanded the scope of the MLCI examination by reviewing additional books and records maintained by the Corporation in response to the concerns raised during the MLCI examination.  The Division's MLCI Report of Examination (the ""Report""), which was issued to Union Capital on the effective date of this Temporary Order, presented the findings of the MLCI examination/inspection (""2009 examination/inspection"") and alleged significant failures to comply with applicable state and federal laws, rules, regulations, and regulatory bulletins governing the conduct of those engaged in the mortgage business in Massachusetts.  Books and Records reviewed by the Division's examiners revealed that multiple loan files underwritten by Kalonji D. Franklin while employed at Union Capital contained certain information including but not limited to the occupancy status, and financial status of certain identified borrowers that was false and/or misleading as fully described in the Report and summarized below. 	 Unfair or Deceptive Acts and Practices  a. Deceptive Business Practices  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 41.09(1) states: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a Licensee to engage in conduct prohibited under 2  09 CMR 42.12A.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(8), states: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker of mortgage lender to falsify income or asset information on a mortgage loan application or mortgage loan documents.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) states: 	 Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 11(a) states; 	 Whenever the commissioner finds that any licensee has violated this chapter or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder, or any other law of the commonwealth applicable to the conduct of a mortgage loan originator on residential property in the commonwealth, the commissioner may, by order, in addition to any other action authorized under this chapter or any rule or regulation made thereunder, impose a penalty upon the person which shall not exceed $5,000 for each violation up to a maximum of $100,000 for such violation plus the costs of investigation. The commissioner may impose a penalty which shall not exceed $5,000 for each violation of this chapter, or any rule or regulation promulgated hereunder, by a person other than a licensee, plus the costs of investigation.  Books and records reviewed during the 2009 examination/inspection revealed that Kalonji D. Franklin while employed as an underwriter at Union Capital, reviewed and submitted mortgage loan documents on behalf of Union Capital to lenders and/or investors, for multiple loan files in which the applicants' financial information including but not limited to applicants' income, assets, and/or employment information differed significantly and was not supported by the information reflected on other pertinent documentation which Kalonji D. Franklin had in his possession as more fully described in the Report. Examples include but are not limited to the following: 	 (a) Borrower A Property Address: Stellman Road, Unit 3, Roslindale, MA Underwriter: Kalonji D. Franklin  A review of books and records provided by Union Capital to the Division's examiners indicate that certain information was misrepresented and omitted during the origination and underwriting of the mortgage loan. The underwriter of record was Kalonji D. Franklin.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners indicate that Borrower A purchased the Stellman Road property on or about March 21, 2007.  A review of the Uniform Residential Loan Application (""1003 Form""), maintained in the loan file reviewed by the Division's examiners revealed that two mortgage loan obligations were omitted on the 1003 Form and not included in the calculation of the debt-to-income ratio. A copy of at least one mortgage statement for a property located on Whitfield Street, in Dorchester was maintained in the loan file. A Registry of Deeds search revealed that at the borrower had purchased and mortgaged at least one other property on or about November 27, 2006. Neither mortgage payments were included in the debt-to-income ratio.  A review of the Corporation's books and records further revealed that the borrower had purchased and financed the Whitfield Street property through Union Capital on October 26, 2006, four months prior to the settlement of the Stellman Road property.  The Division's examiner determined that the monthly payments for the payment of the mortgages on four properties owned by Borrower A would be approximately $10,121 monthly or $121,452 annually including a miscellaneous debt reflected on the credit report reviewed by the Division's examiner. Had Kalonji D. Franklin as the underwriter of record considered all mortgage payments during the underwriting of the mortgage loan, the total debt-to-income ratio would have been 96%.  (b) Borrower B Property Address: Highland, Unit 2 and Unit 3 Roxbury, MA Underwriter, Kalonji D. Franklin  A review of loan files maintained by Union Capital revealed that the certain information was misrepresented on mortgage loan documents maintained in the loan file reviewed by the Division's examiners. Kalonji D. Franklin was the underwriter of record for the purchase of both units.  Borrower B purchased both properties on May 9, 2007 with Union Capital as the lender of record and Kalonji D. Franklin as the underwriter of record. The borrower was qualified for two mortgage loans on each property with a 100% combined loan to value (""CLTV""). Both first mortgage loans for each property were submitted through two different investors, and each 1003 Form submitted to the investors indicated that both units were to be the borrower's primary residence.  A review of the loan file for the purchase of Unit 3, revealed that the 1003 Form failed to include a reference to the proposed mortgage payment for Unit 2. The mortgage payment for Unit 2 also was not considered in the total obligations and debt-to-income ratio. The Division's examiner determined that had both payment obligations been included, the borrower would have had a debt-to-income ratio of 94%.  A review of the Registry of Deeds records indicates that Unit 3 entered into foreclosure on March 5, 2009. Foreclosure proceedings on the Unit 2 were initiated on September 29, 2009.  (c) Borrower C Property Address: Stellman Road, Unit 2, Roslindale, MA Underwriter: Kalonji D. Franklin  A review of books and records maintained and provided by Union Capital to the Division's examiners and Registry of Deeds records indicate that Borrower C was qualified for two mortgage loans with a 100% CLTV for the purchase of the Stellman Road property. Kalonji D. Franklin was the underwriter of record. 		 The 1003 Form reviewed by the Division's examiners reflected five properties in the real estate owned section, of which four were listed as rental properties. The application reported a net rental income loss of $12,794 or $153,528 annually. Information reflected on the 1003 Form indicated that the Borrower was a Supportive Housing Specialist. According to the automated underwriting Form issued by Taylor, Bean & Whitaker, the investor, the borrower had a total monthly debt of $22,361.98 or $268,343.76 annually.  Foreclosure proceedings were initiated on March 18, 2008, approximately 12 months after settlement.  b. Deceptive Business Practices: Misrepresentation of Occupancy Status  The commentary to section 226.2(a)(24) of the Federal Reserve System's Official Staff Commentary on Regulation Z, states in part: ""A consumer can only have one principal dwelling at a time.""  Loan documents, specifically the mortgage deeds identifying Union Capital as the lender of record in the loan files described below contain a provision that states the following: 	 Occupancy. Borrower shall occupy, establish, and use the property as the Borrower's principal residence within 60 days after the execution of this Security Instrument and shall continue to occupy the Property as Borrower's principal residence for at least one year after the date of occupancy, unless Lender otherwise agrees in writing, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, or unless extenuating circumstances exist which are beyond Borrower's control.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2009 examination/inspection revealed that that certain information including the occupancy status of the property was concealed and/or misrepresented to investors. Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners revealed that Kalonji D. Franklin was noted as the underwriter in several loan files reviewed by the Division's examiners. Loan files reviewed indicated that several purchase money mortgage loan applications for multiple properties were submitted by the Union Capital to investors on behalf of an individual borrower within a short period of time, with each application indicating that the subject property was to be used as the borrower's primary residence. Examples include but are not limited to the following: 	 (a) Borrower D: Property: Topliff Street, Dorchester, MA Property: Geneva Avenue, Unit 2, Dorchester, MA Underwriter: Kalonji D. Franklin  Kalonji D. Franklin as the underwriter of record, submitted loan documents to investors during the underwriting of the mortgage loans on behalf of Union Capital for the purchase of two properties for Borrower D on or about April 25, 2007. The borrower applied for two mortgage loans for the purchase of each property with a CLTV of 100%. Each mortgage loan was submitted to the investor with information indicating that the borrower would be occupying each property as their primary residence.  Borrower D purchased the Topliff Street property on May 4, 2007 and a review of documents provided by Union Capital to the Division's examiners indicate that the loan documents reflected that the property would be maintained as the borrower's primary residence.  Borrower D purchased the Geneva Avenue property on June 4, 2007 and a review of documents provided by Union Capital to the Division's examiners indicate that the property would be maintained as the borrower's primary residence.  A review of the documents in both loan files conflicting information. 		 A review of a Verification of Deposit (""VOD"") form maintained in the loan file for the purchase of Geneva Avenue was prepared on April 10, 2007 and indicated that the Borrower maintained a savings and checking account with balances of $8,934 and $22,291 respectively. The VOD indicated that both accounts were opened on March 27, 2004.  The VOD form maintained in the loan file for the purchase of Topliff Street was prepared by the same individual who prepared the Geneva Avenue VOD and was prepared as of May 20, 2007. The VOD indicated that the borrower maintained a savings and checking account and also held a certificate of deposit, with balances of $42,498, $9,934 and $95,000 respectively. The account numbers for the checking and savings account were the same as those reflected on the VOD for the purchase of the Geneva Avenue property. The VOD indicated that the checking and savings accounts were opened on January 27, 2000 and the certificate of deposit was opened on May 18, 2005.  Kalonji D. Franklin as the underwriter of record reviewed all mortgage loan documents submitted to the investor during the origination and underwriting of the mortgage loans.  Foreclosure proceedings were initiated on the Topliff Street property on or about July 30, 2008 and a foreclosure deed was recorded at the Registry of Deeds on January 20, 2009.  Foreclosure proceedings were initiated on the Geneva Avenue property on or about March 26, 2008 and a foreclosure deed was recorded at the Registry of Deeds on May 23, 2008.  (b) Borrower E: Property: D Street, Units 1 and 2 South Boston, MA Underwriter and Loan Originator: Kalonji D. Franklin  Kalonji D. Franklin as the underwriter of record, submitted loan documents to investors during the underwriting of the mortgage loans on behalf of Union Capital for the purchase of both Units 1 and 2 for a property located at D Street in South Boston, for Borrower E on December 26, 2006. The borrower applied was qualified for two mortgage loans or 100 CLTV for the purchase of Unit 1, John K. Richman was the loan originator of record for the first mortgage loan on Unit 1 and Kalonji D. Franklin was the loan originator of record for the second mortgage loan on Unit 1. John Richman was the loan originator of record for the purchase of Unit 2. Union Capital was the lender of record for all transactions. Each mortgage loan was submitted to the investor with information indicating that the borrower would be occupying each property as their primary residence.  Registry of Deeds records indicated that Borrower E purchased Unit 1 on February 14, 2007 and a review of loan documents indicated that the property would be maintained as the borrower's primary residence. 		 Foreclosure proceedings were initiated on the first mortgage loan for Unit 1 on March 18, 2008 and a foreclosure deed was recorded on July 7, 2008.  Registry of deeds records indicated that Borrower E purchased Unit 2 of the D Street property on February 27, 2007 and a review of loan documents indicated that the property would be maintained as the borrower's primary residence. 		 Foreclosure proceedings were initiated on Unit 2 on February 18, 2008 and a foreclosure deed was recorded on May 2, 2008.  (c) Borrower F: Property: Tyler Street, Malden, MA Underwriter: Kalonji Franklin  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners revealed that the borrower applied for two mortgage loans for the refinance with a 100% CLTV. James Edward Hirbour was the loan originator of record for both transactions. Kalonji D. Franklin was the underwriter of record.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiner indicate that the income reflected on two 1003 Forms maintained in the loan file were inconsistent.  A review of one 1003 Form maintained in the loan file indicated that the borrower was employed as a Sales Associate at an automobile dealership, earning a gross monthly income of $8,496, or $101,952 annually. 		 The Division's examiners confirmed that the information reflected on the 1003 Form was utilized for loan qualification and submitted to the investor to whom the mortgage loan was sold by Union Capital.  The loan file reviewed by the examiner also contained a partial copy of the 1003 Form, specifically the income/employment page of a 1003 Form which was initialed by the borrower. The 1003 Form reflected the borrower's gross monthly income as $7,986, or $95,832 annually.  The difference in income between the income reflected on the information submitted to the end investor and the 1003 Form maintained in the loan file was approximately $510 monthly or $6,120 annually.  Foreclosure proceedings were initiated on the Tyler Street property on or about December 20, 2007, ten months after the refinance transaction.  A further review by the Division's examiners revealed that the property was sold for $278,000 on or about July 21, 2008. Information provided to the Division's examiners revealed that the property was sold as a result of a short sale approved by the end investor.  Kalonji D. Franklin, as the underwriter acting on behalf of Union Capital, should have known that information collected by him as the underwriter of record, during the processing and/or underwriting of the mortgage loans would be relied upon by the mortgage lender, financial institution or investor to which the mortgage loans were brokered and/or sold by Union Capital. 	 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 20, Kalonji D. Franklin has failed to demonstrate and maintain the character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that Kalonji D. Franklin, as a licensed mortgage loan originator will act honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 41.03(2)(b).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 20, by submitting misleading and/or inaccurate information to mortgage lenders, financial institutions or investors to whom Union Capital brokered and/or sold mortgage loans to, Kalonji D. Franklin has violated Division's regulation 209 CMR 41.09(1), and Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 20, by falsifying borrowers' income information on Uniform Residential Loan Applications submitted in connection with residential mortgage transactions, Kalonji D. Franklin has violated the Division's regulation 209 CMR 41.09(1), and Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 20, by misrepresenting the occupancy status of multiple borrowers on mortgage loan documents submitted during the origination and processing of the residential mortgage transactions, Kalonji D. Franklin has violated the Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) and the Office of the Attorney General's implementing regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 20, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 Kalonji D. Franklin has engaged in, is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that it is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage loan originator including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 41.00 et seq.; and  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to Kalonji D. Franklin.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 20, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of Kalonji D. Franklin's original mortgage loan originator license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 20 present sufficient grounds for the revocation of Kalonji D. Franklin's mortgage loan originator license pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 7 and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 41.04(2)(c)(1), 209 CMR 41.04(2)(c)(2) and 209 CMR 41.04(2)(c)(3). 	 ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that Kalonji D. Franklin shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of a mortgage loan originator, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Temporary Order. Therefore, Kalonji D. Franklin is ordered to immediately cease soliciting or accepting, either directly or indirectly, any residential mortgage loan applications from consumers for residential property located in Massachusetts.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Temporary Order shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 30A.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Temporary Order shall not be construed as approving any act, practice, or conduct not specifically set forth herein which was, is, or may be in violation of relevant state or federal laws and regulations.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such Temporary Order shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from Kalonji D. Franklin within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this Temporary Order. If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this Temporary Order shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.

206,12/3/2021,2009,Temporary Cease and Desist,"Ideal Mortgage Bankers, LTD. dba Lend America",Mortgage Company,???,"Fall River, MA",https://www.mass.gov/temporary-order-to-cease-and-desist/ideal-mortgage-bankers-ltd-dba-lend-america," COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  Suffolk, SS.  COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE LENDER AND  MORTGAGE BROKER  LICENSING  Docket No. 2009-138  FINDINGS OF FACT AND  TEMPORARY ORDER TO  CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  IDEAL MORTGAGE BANKERS, LTD. D/B/A  LEND AMERICA.  Melville, New York  Mortgage Company License No. MC5278  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that IDEAL MORTGAGE BANKERS, LTD., D/B/A LEND AMERICA (""Lend America"" or the ""Corporation""), located at 520 Broadhollow Road, Melville, New York has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""Temporary Order"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b) and chapter 255F, section 8(b).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  The Division, through the Commissioner, also has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons engaged in the business of a mortgage loan originator in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 2 and its implementing regulation 209 CMR 41.00  et seq .  Lend America is, and at all relevant times has been, a foreign corporation doing business in the Commonwealth. Lend America's main office is located at 520 Broadhollow Road, Melville, New York.  Lend America is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage lender and mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner issued a mortgage company license, license number MC5278 to Lend America to engage in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker on or about October 15, 2008. License number MC5278 authorized Lend America to conduct the mortgage company business from the Corporation's main office located at 520 Broadhollow Road, Melville, New York. 	 A. Failure to Fund Certain Residential Mortgage Loan Obligations  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.12A(16) states: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage lender to contract with a consumer through the underwriting and subsequent execution of mortgage loan closing documents and thereafter fail to fund the mortgage loan.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) states: 	 Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.06(8) states: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a lender to fail to disburse funds in accordance with any commitment or agreement with the borrower.  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.12A(20) states: 	 A violation of 209 CMR 42.12A shall constitute grounds for the issuance of a cease and desist order under M.G.L. c. 255E, § 7; shall constitute grounds for license suspension or revocation under M.G.L. c. 255E, § 6 and shall constitute grounds for an administrative fine or penalty under M.G.L. c. 255E, §§ 11 and 12.  On or about December 1, 2009, representatives from the Division, by and through discussions held with representatives of other state banking and mortgage lending regulators (collectively, the ""Mortgage Regulators""), contacted Lend America and requested that the Corporation provide a pipeline report of pending residential mortgage loan applications in all states in which Lend America operates, including Massachusetts. In response to that request, on December 3, 2009, Lend America provided the Mortgage Regulators with a pipeline report that indicated, in part, that as of December 1, 2009, the Corporation failed to disburse loan proceeds for at least two (2) mortgage loan transactions involving residential property in Massachusetts for which closings had occurred. In addition, the pipeline report provided by the Corporation identified at least eleven (11) mortgage loan transactions involving residential property in Massachusetts for which Lend America will fail to timely disburse loan proceeds for closings that are scheduled to occur.  Based upon information and belief, the two mortgage loans referenced in Paragraph 9, have not yet funded as of the effective date of this Temporary Order.  Based upon information and belief, the pipeline report understates the actual number of unfunded transactions based upon information obtained by the Division from the Mortgage Regulators. 	 B. Failure to Provide Notice of Cessation of Operations  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.13(2) states: 	 Licensees shall provide thirty days prior written notice of any change or closing of a Massachusetts location to the Commissioner and shall contain such other information as the Commissioner may require.  According to the Division's records, Lend America conducts all of the Corporation's mortgage business in the Commonwealth, through the Corporation's main office located in Melville, New York.  On or around December 1, 2009 the Division was notified by the New York State Banking Department that Lend America ceased operations.  The Division reviewed Lend America's website,  www.lendamerica.com , as of December 1, 2009, which confirmed the information referenced in Paragraph 14. The notice stated, in part: 	 Effective immediately the company has ceased it[s] loan origination and operations. The company will continue to operate to fulfill its obligations to past and current borrowers, FNMA, GNMA and the regulatory agencies.  As of the issuance of this Temporary Order, Lend America has failed to provide written notification to the Division of the Corporation's cessation of operations. 	 C. Failure to Provide Notification of Significant Events  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.12(1)(f) states in part: 	 A Licensee shall notify the Commissioner immediately, and in writing within one business day, of the occurrence of any of the following significant developments: . . . (f) Suspension or termination of the Licensee's status as an approved seller or seller/servicer by the Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, Government National Mortgage Association or an investor approved under  209 CMR 42.11A(1)(a) .  On December 1, 2009, the Division became aware through a press release issued by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (""HUD"") on or about November 30, 2009, that the Federal Housing Administration (""FHA"") had withdrawn Lend America's approval with FHA. The press release stated that the action would be effective immediately and prevented the Corporation from originating and underwriting new FHA-insured mortgages. The press release further stated that the Government National Mortgage Association (""Ginnie Mae"") had defaulted Lend America and the Corporation would no longer be able to issue Ginnie Mae securities.  As of the issuance of this Temporary Order, Lend America has not notified the Division of the aforementioned events. 	 D. Uncertainty of Lend America's Maintenance of the Statutory Requirements for Holding a Mortgage Lender and Mortgage Broker License in Massachusetts  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.04(2)(b)3 and 209 CMR 42.07(2)(b)3 pertaining to the licensing of mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers respectively, states in part: 	 The Commissioner may also deny such an application if the Applicant has: conducted, or will conduct, its business in an unsafe and unsound manner…  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.03(2)(c) and 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c) pertaining to mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers respectively, states in part: 	 An Applicant shall be required to submit detailed information supporting the following general requirements:  Character and Fitness. An Applicant shall submit information demonstrating that the Applicant possesses the character, reputation, integrity and fitness to engage in the business of a mortgage lender in an honest, fair, sound and efficient manner.  Based upon information and belief, Lend America has a portfolio of Massachusetts mortgage loan applications in various stages of processing, underwriting, and funding and based upon the foregoing, the Division is unable to measure the extent to which the FHA and Ginnie Mae actions have impacted the Corporation's ability to meet its obligations to Massachusetts consumers. 	 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 22, Lend America's acts or practices of contracting with consumer(s), through the underwriting and subsequent execution of mortgage loan closing documents relating to Massachusetts residential property, and thereafter failing to fund the mortgage loan(s) constitutes unfair and/or deceptive acts or practices in violation of Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(16) Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2 and the Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.06(8).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 22, due to the delay and/or failure in funding contractual mortgage loan obligations Lend America has harmed consumers, mortgage brokers, and/or other parties in as many as thirteen (13) residential mortgage loan transactions in the Commonwealth by engaging in acts or practices which are unfair and/or deceptive in violation of in violation of Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(16) Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2 and the Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.06(8).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 22, Lend America failed to provide the Commissioner with thirty days prior written notice of the Corporation's intention to cease business operations in violation of 209 CMR 42.13(2).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 22, Lend America failed to notify the Commissioner within one business day of the termination of the Corporation's relationship with the Government National Mortgage Association in violation of 209 CMR 42.12(1)(f).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 22, Lend America has failed to demonstrate the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulations 209 CMR 42.03(2)(c) and 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 22, the public interest will be harmed by delay in issuing an Order to Cease and Desist under General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(a) because, upon information and belief, Lend America has a portfolio of Massachusetts mortgage loan applications in various stages of processing, underwriting, and funding which require immediate action to protect the interests of the affected Massachusetts consumers. Contrary to these interests, Lend America has announced its intention to cease all mortgage loan origination operations immediately.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 22, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 Lend America has engaged in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that it is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. ; and  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to Lend America.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 22, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of Lend America's original mortgage lender and mortgage broker license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 22 present sufficient grounds for the revocation of Lend America's mortgage lender and mortgage broker licenses pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 and the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.04(2)(b), 42.07(2)(b). 	 ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that Lend America and any and all officers, members, managers, employees, independent contractors, or agents, operating on behalf of Lend America, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of: (a) a mortgage lender and mortgage broker, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, and (b) a mortgage loan originator, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Temporary Order. Therefore, Lend America is ordered to immediately cease soliciting or accepting, either directly or indirectly, any residential mortgage loan applications from consumers for residential property located in Massachusetts.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Lend America, shall immediately place any fees previously collected from Massachusetts consumers relative to any pending mortgage loan applications in a separate escrow account maintained at a federally insured bank.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Lend America shall immediately place with one or more qualified broker(s) or lender(s), with no loss to applicants, the following: (a) Lend America's entire portfolio of Massachusetts residential mortgage loans which were closed by Lend America, and remain unfunded as of the issuance of this Temporary Order; and (b) Lend America's entire pending application list of Massachusetts residential mortgage loans. It being understood that ""no loss to the applicant"" shall mean that any loan which was closed by Lend America, as well as any application which was approved by Lend America, shall be placed to a lender willing to fund, or close, the mortgage loan under the same terms and conditions extended by Lend America. In the event that no such placement can be made, Lend America shall either independently fund the mortgage loan under such terms and conditions or buy down the mortgage loan offered by the lender so that the applicant does not incur a loss as a result of such placement. Lend America shall obtain the prior approval of the Commissioner before placing such applications to the qualified lender(s) or broker(s) as appropriate.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that in any instance in which Lend America failed to fund a closed loan and in which the consumer, prior to the effective date of this Temporary Order, obtained funding through an alternate lender, Lend America shall reimburse each consumer the amount necessary to put the consumer in the same position as if Lend America had funded the mortgage loan under the terms and conditions agreed upon at the closing of the loan.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Lend America shall submit to the Commissioner a detailed record, prepared as of the date of submission, of all of the Corporation's pending residential mortgage loan applications on property located in Massachusetts. The records to be produced shall include all information on file regarding the Corporation's Massachusetts mortgage loan portfolio, including but not necessarily limited to, the following: 	 Within one (1) day of the effective date of this Temporary Order, Lend America shall submit to the Commissioner all information on file as of the date of submission regarding the Corporation's portfolio of mortgage loans that were closed by Lend America prior to the effective date of this Temporary Order, but remain as yet unfunded. Such information shall include, but is not limited to, the following: The names of all individuals from whom Lend America processed an application and closed the residential mortgage loan, but failed to fund; the applicants' addresses and telephone numbers; the loan number; the amount of all prepaid loan fees submitted by the customer; the amount of each loan; the loan terms; the current funding status; the actual closing dates; the loan purpose (i.e. purchase or refinance); and identification of the applicable lender with whom each application will be placed.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE BROKER  LICENSING  Docket No. 2009-136  FINDINGS OF FACT AND  TEMPORARY ORDER TO  CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  FINANCIAL RESOURCES MORTGAGE, INC.  Meredith, New Hampshire  Mortgage Broker License No.: MB1563  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that Financial Resources Mortgage, Inc., (""Financial Resources Mortgage"" or the ""Corporation""), located at 15 Northview Drive, Meredith, New Hampshire has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapters 255E and 255F, and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 41.00 and 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""Temporary Order"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b) and chapter 255F, section 11(a).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division"") is an agency of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts with jurisdiction over matters relating to the licensing and regulation of those engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2 and Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8.  The Division also has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons engaged in the business of a mortgage loan originator in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 2 and its implementing regulation 209 CMR 41.00  et seq .  Financial Resources Mortgage is, and at all relevant times, has been a foreign corporation conducting business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Financial Resources Mortgage's main office is located at 15 Northview Drive, Meredith, New Hampshire.  Financial Resources Mortgage is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage broker license, license number MB1563, to Financial Resources Mortgage to engage in the business of a mortgage broker on or about November 8, 1999. At all relevant times Scott D. Farah has been President and sole officer/director of the Corporation.  The Division's records indicate that Financial Resources Mortgage has no licensed mortgage loan originators sponsored by the Corporation to conduct business in Massachusetts, and the Corporation is currently in an ""approved-inactive"" status as reflected on the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System (""NMLS"").  A. Failure to Provide Notice of Significant Events  (1) Failure to Provide Notification of Regulatory Action  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.12(1)(c) states, in part:  A Licensee shall notify the Commissioner immediately, and in writing within one business day, of the occurrence of any of the following significant developments: . . . (c) [R]eceiving notification of the institution of . . . cease and desist, suspension or revocation procedures, or other formal or informal regulatory action, in any state against the Licensee, and the reasons thereof.  On November 13, 2009, the State of New Hampshire Banking Department (""New Hampshire Department"") issued an Order to Show Cause and Cease and Desist Order Case No. 09-127, against Financial Resources Mortgage (""New Hampshire Order""). The New Hampshire Order contains a Staff Petition in which the staff of the New Hampshire Department alleged the following violations of New Hampshire law:  Violation of New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated (""RSA"") 397-A: 3, II: Loan Originator Operating Without a License;  Violation of RSA 397-A: 3, III: Employment of Unlicensed Loan Originator;  Violation of Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Title V, Section 501(a) via RSA 397-A: 2 III;  Violation of RSA 397-A: II, I Record Keeping: Failure to Properly Maintain Records;  Violation of RSA 397-A: 11, IV Record Keeping: Failure to Preserve Original Records; and  Violation of RSA 397-A: 10, III Failure to Provide Notification of Closing;  As of the effective date of this Temporary Order, the Division has not received notification from Financial Resources Mortgage of the New Hampshire Order.  (2) Failure to Provide Notice of Cessation of Operations  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.13(2) states:  Licensees shall provide thirty days prior written notice of any change or closing of a Massachusetts location to the Commissioner and shall contain such other information as the Commissioner may require.  On or about November 13, 2009, the Division became aware, through an article appearing on an online publication and the New Hampshire Order referenced above, that Financial Resources Mortgage had ceased operations.  According to the Division's records, Financial Resources Mortgage conducts all of the Corporation's mortgage business in the Commonwealth, through the Corporation's main office located in Meredith, New Hampshire.  As of the issuance of this Temporary Order, Financial Resources Mortgage has not notified the Division of the Corporation's cessation of operations.  B. Failure to Provide Access to Books and Records  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8 states, in part, that:  Each licensee shall, when directed by said commissioner, permit said commissioner or his duly authorized representative to inspect its relevant records and evidence of compliance with the provisions of this chapter or any rule or regulation issued hereunder and with any other law, rule or regulation applicable to the conduct of the business for which it is licensed under this chapter . . . . For the purposes of such inspection, said commissioner or his representative shall have access to the offices and place of business, books, accounts, papers, records and files of all such licensees.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.09(4) states in part:  [A] Licensee shall make such other statements and reports to the Commissioner as he or she may require from time to time…  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 48.03(1) states in part:  Each Licensee shall keep and use its books, records, and accounts in a manner which will allow the Commissioner to determine whether the Licensee is complying with the provisions of . . . General Laws chapter 255E and other provisions applicable to the conduct of the licensed business.  On November 13, 2009, the Division repeatedly attempted to submit a letter via facsimile and e-mail to  Scott D. Farah, President of Financial Resources Mortgage, requesting that Financial Resources Mortgage submit, among other things, a detailed record of all pending residential mortgage loan applications on properties located in all of the states in which Financial Resources Mortgage operated the mortgage broker business, including Massachusetts. The Division's attempts to contact Financial Resources Mortgage via e-mail and facsimile were unsuccessful, as a result the Division forwarded the aforementioned request via the United States Postal Service. The Division required that such information be submitted to the Division no later than November 16, 2009.  As of the date of this Temporary Order, the information requested in Paragraph 16 of this Temporary Order has not been provided to the Division.  As set forth above, Financial Resources Mortgage has been unable or unwilling to provide the Division with information regarding the location and status of any pending Massachusetts residential loan applications that the Corporation may have taken prior to the cessation of operations.  Based upon the foregoing facts, the Division is unable to ascertain the current status of all of Financial Resources Mortgage's Massachusetts residential loan applications which remained pending at the time Financial Resources Mortgage elected to cease operations and the extent of the harm, if any, to Massachusetts residential loan applicants.  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 19, Financial Resources Mortgage failed to notify the Commissioner in writing, within one business day, that on November 13, 2009 the New Hampshire Banking Department issued an Order to Show Cause and Cease and Desist Order in violation of the Division's Regulation 209 CMR 42.12(1)(c)  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 19, Financial Resources Mortgage failed to provide the Commissioner with thirty days prior written notice of the Corporation's intention to cease business operations, in violation of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.13(2).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 19, Financial Resources Mortgage has failed to provide the Division with information regarding the status of pending loan applications that may have been taken prior to the cessation of operations, in violation of General Laws chapter 255E, section 8 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.09(4).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 19, Financial Resources Mortgage has failed to provide the Division with sufficient information regarding the location of its books and records, specifically those relating to any pending Massachusetts residential loan applications, in violation of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 48.03(1).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 19, Financial Resources Mortgage has failed to demonstrate the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 19, the Commissioner has determined that:  Financial Resources Mortgage has engaged in, is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that it is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage broker including, but not limited to, the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 7 and the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00 et seq.; and  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to Financial Resources Mortgage.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 19, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of Financial Resources Mortgage's original mortgage broker license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 19 present sufficient grounds for the revocation of Financial Resources Mortgage's mortgage broker license pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.07(2)(b).  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that Financial Resources Mortgage and any and all officers, members, managers, employees, independent contractors, or agents, operating on behalf of Financial Resources Mortgage, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of: (a) a mortgage broker, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, and (b) a mortgage loan originator, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Temporary Order. Therefore, Financial Resources Mortgage is ordered to immediately cease soliciting or accepting, either directly or indirectly, any residential mortgage loan applications from consumers for residential property located in Massachusetts.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Financial Resources Mortgage, shall immediately place any fees previously collected from Massachusetts consumers relative to any pending mortgage loan applications in a separate escrow account maintained at a federally insured bank.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Financial Resources Mortgage shall immediately place with one or more qualified broker(s) or lender(s), as appropriate based on the status of the application and with no loss to applicants, all of its pending Massachusetts residential mortgage loan applications. Financial Resources Mortgage shall obtain the prior approval of the Commissioner before placing such applications to the qualified broker(s) or lender(s).  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Financial Resources Mortgage shall submit to the Commissioner a detailed record, prepared as of the date of submission, of all of the Corporation's pending residential mortgage loan applications on property located in Massachusetts. The records to be produced shall be submitted to the Commissioner within five (5) days of the effective date of this Temporary Order and shall include all information on file, regarding the Corporation's open application list, including but not necessarily limited to, the following:  All information on file as of the date of submission regarding Financial Resources Mortgage's open application list as a mortgage broker, including but not limited to, the following: The names of all individuals from whom Financial Resources Mortgage has accepted an application for a residential mortgage loan; the applicants' addresses and telephone numbers; the amount of all prepaid loan fees submitted by the customer; the amount of each loan; application status (i.e. filed, submitted to lenders, cleared to close, etc.); scheduled closing dates; rate lock status; and a list identifying the applicable broker or lender with whom the applicants' application was placed. The latter list should include telephone numbers of contact persons familiar with the Corporation's submitted loans.  Financial Resources Mortgage shall immediately secure all pending residential mortgage loan application files and, to the extent that any original documents must be forwarded to the relevant mortgage lender(s) and or mortgage broker(s) pursuant to Paragraph 29 of this Temporary Order, a copy of such document, correspondence, or paper relating to the mortgage loan shall be retained in Financial Resources Mortgage's books and records and shall be available to the Commissioner, in their entirety, upon request.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Temporary Order shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 30A.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such Temporary Order shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from Financial Resources within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this Temporary Order. If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this Temporary Order shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE LOAN ORIGINATOR LICENSING  Docket No. 2009-167-MLO  FINDINGS OF FACT AND  TEMPORARY ORDER TO  CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  LINDA SHAY DEFEO  Mortgage Loan Originator License No. MLO44853  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that LINDA SHAY DEFEO (""Linda DeFeo""), has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 41.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""Temporary Order"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255F, section 11(a).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons engaged in the activities of a mortgage loan originator in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 2.  Linda DeFeo is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage loan originator under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage loan originator license, license number MLO44853 to Linda DeFeo to engage in the business of a mortgage loan originator on or about October 31, 2008.  On December 21, 2009, a Grand Jury, impaneled in the Suffolk County Superior Court, Suffolk County, Massachusetts, returned an indictment against Linda DeFeo charging her with seventeen criminal counts including: ten counts of Larceny over $250; six counts of Making a False or Exaggerated Statement; and one count of Attempted Larceny over $250.  According to the December 22, 2009 press release issued by the Office of the Attorney General of Massachusetts, Linda DeFeo was indicted on December 21, 2009 for her role in a mortgage fraud scheme pursuant to which fraudulent documents were used to defraud homeowners and financial lending institutions in real estate transactions involving distressed properties in the Greater Boston area. The Attorney General's investigators allege, among other things, that Linda DeFeo conspired with real estate investors to submit mortgage loan applications to financial lending institutions with false information in order to secure 100% financing for the borrowers. In addition, investigators allege that the real estate investors were able to submit inflated property appraisals and false purchase and sale agreements to the financial lending institutions through Linda DeFeo. Linda DeFeo is alleged to have known that such documentation was false when she submitted the information to the financial lending institutions.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 4(a)(iii) states, in part: 	  The commissioner shall issue a mortgage loan originator license to an applicant therefore unless the applicant: (iii) has failed to demonstrate financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity and general fitness such as to command the confidence of the community and to warrant a determination that such applicant will operate honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest, consistent with the purposes of this chapter     Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 11(a) states, in part: 	  The commissioner may for the administration and enforcement of this chapter, pursuant to chapter 30A: (ii) deny, suspend, revoke, condition or decline to renew a license if a . . . licensee fails at any time to meet the requirements of section 4 . . . (vii) enter immediate temporary orders to cease business under a license if the commissioner determines that . . . the licensee is currently in violation of this chapter.  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 6, Linda DeFeo has failed to demonstrate and maintain the character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness such as to command the confidence of the community and to warrant a determination that she will operate honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest, in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 41.04(2)(d).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 6, the Commissioner has determined that:  	(a) Linda DeFeo has engaged in, is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that it is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage loan originator including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 41.00 et seq.; and  	(b) The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to Linda DeFeo.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 6, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of Linda DeFeo's original mortgage loan originator license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 6 present sufficient grounds for the revocation of Linda DeFeo's mortgage loan originator license pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 11. 	 ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that Linda DeFeo shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of a mortgage loan originator, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts. Therefore, Linda DeFeo is ordered to immediately cease soliciting, accepting, or further originating, either directly or indirectly, any residential mortgage loan applications from consumers for residential property located in Massachusetts.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Linda DeFeo shall submit to the Division a detailed record, prepared as of the date of submission, of all pending residential mortgage loan applications which she has originated on property located in Massachusetts. The records to be produced shall be submitted to the Commissioner within five (5) days of the effective date of this Temporary Order and shall include all information on file, regarding her open application list, including but not necessarily limited to, the following: 	 All information on file as of the date of submission regarding Linda DeFeo's open application list as a mortgage loan originator, including but not limited to, the following: The names of all individuals for whom Linda DeFeo originated an application for a residential mortgage loan; the applicants' addresses and telephone numbers; the amount of all prepaid loan fees submitted by the customer; the amount of each loan; application status (i.e. filed, submitted to lenders, cleared to close, etc.); scheduled closing dates; rate lock status; and a list identifying the applicable broker or lender with whom the applicants' application was placed.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Temporary Order shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 30A.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Temporary Order shall not be construed as approving any act, practice, or conduct not specifically set forth herein which was, is, or may be in violation of relevant state or federal laws and regulations.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such Temporary Order shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from Linda DeFeo within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this Temporary Order. If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this Temporary Order shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.

(""First Investors"" or the ""Corporation""), at all relevant times, a licensed mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2 and its implementing regulation 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , to cease and desist from transacting business in the Commonwealth as a mortgage broker; revocation of First Investors' Massachusetts mortgage broker license MB0063; and such other equitable relief as may be necessary due to First Investors' failure to maintain and exercise the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that its business will be operated honestly, fairly, soundly, and efficiently in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).

Brown (""James Brown""), a licensed mortgage loan originator under Massachusetts General Laws, chapter 255F, section 2 and its implementing regulation 209 CMR 41.00  et seq ., to cease and desist from transacting business in the Commonwealth as a mortgage loan originator; revocation of James Brown's Massachusetts mortgage loan originator license MLO17945; and such other equitable relief as may be necessary due to James Brown's failure to maintain the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness such as to command the confidence of the community that would warrant the belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 41.05. 	 JURISDICTION AND VENUE  The Division, through the Commissioner, is an agency of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts with jurisdiction over matters relating to the licensing and regulation of those engaged in the business of a mortgage broker pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2 and Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8; and of those engaged in the business of a mortgage loan originator pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F.  At all relevant times, First Investors has been engaged in the business of a mortgage broker of residential property in Massachusetts.  At all relevant times, James Brown has been engaged in the business of a mortgage loan originator of residential property in Massachusetts. According to the Division's records, at all relevant times, James Brown performed as a mortgage loan originator on behalf of First Investors. 	 RESPONDENT  At all relevant times, First Investors has been a corporation conducting business in the Commonwealth with its main office located at 24 Trapelo Road, Belmont, Massachusetts.  First Investors was licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage broker license, license number MB0063, to First Investors to engage in the business of a mortgage broker on or about December 17, 1992.  At all relevant times, James Brown was the President and sole owner of First Investors.  James Brown is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage loan originator under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 2. According to the Division's records, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage loan originator license, license number MLO17945, to James Brown to engage in the business of a mortgage loan originator on or about January 28, 2009. 	 REGULATORY BACKGROUND  Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division is authorized to inspect the books, accounts, papers, records, and files of mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers transacting business in Massachusetts to determine compliance with the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E and any rule, or regulation issued thereunder, and with any law, rule, or regulation applicable to the conduct of the business of a mortgage broker.  On November 14, 2008, pursuant to the authority granted under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division commenced an examination/inspection of the books, accounts, papers, records, and files maintained by First Investors to evaluate the Corporation's compliance with the laws, regulations, and regulatory bulletins applicable to the conduct of a mortgage broker business in Massachusetts (the ""examination/inspection"").  The Division's Report of Examination/Inspection (the ""Report""), was issued to First Investors on the effective date of this Order and Notice and alleged significant failures to comply with applicable state and federal laws, rules, regulations, and regulatory bulletins governing the conduct of those engaged in the business of a mortgage broker in Massachusetts. The findings and conclusions of the Report are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference. 	 A. False and/or Misleading Representations of Prospective Borrowers' Income and/or Asset Information  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(8), effective as of September, 8, 2006, states: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker or mortgage lender to falsify income or asset information on a mortgage loan application or mortgage loan documents.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) states: 	 Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1) states, in part: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to make any representation or statement of fact if the representation or statement is false or misleading or has the tendency or capacity to be misleading.  Books and records reviewed during the examination/inspection revealed that First Investors had completed several Uniform Residential Loan Applications in which the applicants' base employment income and/or the asset information differed significantly from the information reflected on other pertinent documentation. Examples include, but are not limited to the following documents, as summarized below: 	 Loan No.(s) 11648498 and 11648499. 		 The first and second lien stated income purchase loan applications prepared by First Investors for loans which closed on August 9, 2006 indicated that the gross monthly base employment income of the applicant, a senior technology manager for a national bank, was $10,468.18, or $125,618 annually;  The loan file contained the borrower's current pay stubs which referenced the borrower's gross annual income as of July 31, 2006 as $55,944.83, which indicates a gross annual income of approximately $95,905;  The discrepancy in income between the borrower's income set forth in the borrower's pay-stub and the annual salary reported on the loan application prepared by First Investors reveals that First Investors overstated the applicant's gross income by approximately $29,713.  Loan No. 1508590 		 The ""stated income fixed asset"" mortgage loan application prepared by First Investors for a refinance loan which closed on November 16, 2006 indicated that the gross monthly base employment income of the borrower, a plumber, was $8,009, or $96,108 annually. The application also listed the borrower's assets, including $12,000 in a savings account;  The loan file contained the borrower's 2005 IRS Form 1040 U.S. Individual Tax return which listed the borrower's total income as $29,863;  The loan file contained a Verification of Deposit (""VOD"") form completed by a bank representative as of November 6, 2006 which lists a balance in the savings account of $3,352.67;  The discrepancy in income between the borrower's income as set forth in the borrower's tax return and the income reported on the loan application prepared by First Investors reveals that First Investors overstated the borrower's gross income by approximately $66,245;  The discrepancy in the borrower's asset information between the amount set forth in the VOD and the asset information reported on the loan application prepared by First Investors reveals that First Investors overstated the borrower's savings account balance by approximately $8,647.33.  Loan No. 6518100048 		 The full documentation residential loan application prepared by First Investors for a loan which closed on November 7, 2008, the applicant's gross monthly income is reported as $11,000 or $132,000 annually;  The loan file contained the borrower's current pay stubs which referenced the borrower's gross annual income as of September 3, 2008 of approximately $58,358, which indicates a gross annual income of approximately $87,537;  The discrepancy in income between the borrower's income set forth in the borrower's pay-stub and the annual salary reported on the loan application prepared by First Investors reveals that First Investors overstated the applicant's gross income by approximately $44,462;  No portion of the $132,000 annual income reported by First Investors on the prepared application was identified as bonuses, commissions, or anything other than base income of the applicant.  The same or similar practices as referenced in the Paragraph above were also found in the following additional residential mortgage loan transactions reviewed by the Division's examiners: Loan No.(s): (x) 1508600; (y) 0001724163; and (z) 1093965 & 11460341. Each of the mortgage loan transactions referenced in Paragraphs 16 and 17 of this Order and Notice were originated by James Brown on behalf of First Investors. The examiners' specific findings are fully described in the Report and are incorporated herein by reference.  At the conclusion of the onsite portion of the Division's examination/inspection, First Investors notified the Division of First Investors intent to obtain additional documentation from the referenced borrowers and/or the lenders of record to address and/or clarify the Division's findings detailed above. As of the effective date of this Order and Notice, First Investors had not submitted to the Division any such additional, supplementing documentation.  First Investors knew or should have known that the above referenced income and/or asset information would be relied upon in underwriting the mortgage loan by the mortgage lender or financial institution to which the mortgage loan applications were brokered by First Investors. 	 B. Unearned Fee  The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, (""RESPA"") implementing regulation, 24 CFR 3500.14(c) states, in part: 	 No person shall give and no person shall accept any portion, split, or percentage of any charge made or received for the rendering of a settlement service in connection with a transaction involving a federally related mortgage loan other than for services actually performed. A charge by a person for which no or nominal services are performed or for which duplicative fees are charged is an unearned fee and violates this section.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the examination/inspection indicate that First Investors charged a consumer an ""escrow waiver fee"" for which no service was rendered by First Investors. 	 C. Providing Mortgage Lender Disclosures to Consumers When Acting in the Capacity of a Mortgage Broker  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 183, section 28C(a) states in part: 	 A lender shall not knowingly make a home loan if the home loan pays off all or part of an existing home loan that was consummated within the prior 60 months or other debt of the borrower, unless the refinancing is in the borrower's interest. The ""borrower's interest"" shall be narrowly construed, and the burden is upon the lender to determine that the refinancing is in the borrower's interest.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 53.07(1)(b) states, in part: 	 A lender may request that a borrower acknowledge receipt of such a worksheet or other documentation; provided, however, a lender shall not shift the burden to the borrower to demonstrate that a home loan is in the borrowers' interest.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the examination/inspection revealed that First Investors provided consumers with a ""Statement of Borrower's Benefits"" (""Form""). By applicable statute and regulation, the determination of the borrower's interest is exclusively the lender's responsibility and the burden cannot be shifted to the borrower by the mortgage lender or mortgage broker. By distributing the Form to prospective borrowers, First Investors exceeded its authority as a mortgage broker. Moreover, the Form's language appeared to shift the burden to the consumers to demonstrate that the loan was in the borrowers' interest and to their benefit, as further described in the Report.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the examination/inspection revealed that, in all files reviewed, First Investors provided consumers with the Right to Receive a Copy of Appraisal Notice. Such notice is required to be provided by the mortgage lender. 	 D. Failure to Properly Maintain Books and Records  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.09(1) states: 	 Each Licensee shall keep and use its books, records and accounts in a manner which will allow the Commissioner to determine whether the Licensee is complying with the provisions of M.G.L. c. 255E and applicable state and federal laws and regulations. Each Licensee shall comply with the provisions of 209 CMR 48.00... (b) The mortgage broker ... shall retain for a minimum of three years after a mortgage loan is made the following: the original loan origination and compensation agreement as set out in 209 CMR 42.16; a copy of the settlement statement; an account of fees received in connection with the loan; correspondence; papers or records relating to the loan; and such other documents as the Commissioner may require.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the examination/inspection indicated that First Investors failed to retain all correspondence and records relating to the loan transactions. Violations include but are not limited to, the failure to retain final loan applications, the failure to retain correspondence and documentation relating to the transaction from the lender, and the failure to properly date initial loan applications and/or other disclosure documents, as further described in the Report. 	 E. Failure to Provide Required Disclosures  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(12) states: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker or mortgage lender to engage in a pattern or practice of failing to make any disclosure to a consumer required by and at the time specified by any applicable state or federal law, regulation or directive.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the examination/inspection revealed that First Investors failed to retain evidence of having provided applicants with the credit score disclosure required under Section 609(g) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 [15 U.S.C. § 1681g(g)]. This practice was observed in all loan files reviewed during the examination/inspection.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the examination/inspection revealed that First Investors failed to provide applicants with the Notice of Privacy Policies and Practices in the form required pursuant to the Federal Trade Commission's Regulation 16 CFR 313. This practice was observed in all of the loan files reviewed during the examination/inspection, as further identified in the Report. 	 F. Loan Origination and Compensation Agreement  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(5) states, in part: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker to fail to provide to the consumer at the time of application the loan origination and compensation agreement required under 209 CMR 42.16. The content of the agreement shall strictly conform to 209 CMR 42.16 and include signatures and dates by the consumer(s) and the mortgage broker.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the examination/inspection revealed that, in all of the files reviewed, First Investors failed to provide a Loan Origination and Compensation Agreement that strictly conformed to the requirements contained in the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.16. In addition, several loan files the Loan Origination and Compensation Agreements contained therein were not completely filled out, as further described in the Report. 	 G. Other Violations  In addition to the violations specifically set forth in this Order and Notice, the Report provided to First Investors in conjunction with the issuance of this Order and Notice, describes other violations and areas of concern observed during the examination/inspection.

CHARGE SIX : By failing to provide all required disclosures to consumers, First Investors has violated the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(12).

For purposes of this provision, ""reduce"" means to collect, charge-off, or improve the quality of the asset so as to warrant its removal from the adverse classification by the FDIC and the Division of Banks. The Risk Reduction Plan shall address each asset so classified with a balance in excess of $250,000 and provide the following:  The name under which the asset is carried on the books of the Bank;  Type of asset;  Actions to be taken in order to reduce the classified asset; and  Timeframes for accomplishing the proposed actions.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE LOAN  ORIGINATOR LICENSING  Docket No. 2010-043  ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE  AND NOTICE OF RIGHT  TO A HEARING  In the Matter of  KENNAN ROSS STARTZELL  Mortgage Loan Originator License No. MLO41311  ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLAINT  The Commonwealth of Massachusetts Division of Banks (the ""Division""), by and through the Commissioner of Banks of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the ""Commissioner  "") , for its Order to Show Cause and Notice of Right to a Hearing (""Order and Notice""), alleges as follows:  The Division brings this action under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 11 to obtain temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief: ordering Kennan Ross Startzell (""Kennan Startzell""), a licensed mortgage loan originator under Massachusetts General Laws, chapter 255F, section 2 and its implementing regulation 209 CMR 41.00  et seq ., to cease and desist from transacting business in the Commonwealth as a mortgage loan originator; prohibiting Kennan Startzell from any further actions, in any manner, as a mortgage loan originator or prohibiting him from being employed by, as agent of, or operating on behalf of a licensee under chapter 255E or 255F or any other business which requires a license from the Commissioner; revocation of Kennan Startzell's Massachusetts mortgage loan originator license ML041311; and such other equitable relief as may be necessary due to Kennan Startzell's failure to maintain the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness such as to command the confidence of the community that would warrant the belief that Kennan Startzell will operate honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 41.05. 	 JURISDICTION AND VENUE  The Division is an agency of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts with jurisdiction over matters relating to the licensing and regulation of those engaged in the business of a mortgage broker and mortgage loan originator pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E and chapter 255F, respectively.  At all relevant times, Kennan Startzell has been engaged in the business of a mortgage broker and/or mortgage loan originator of mortgage loan applications relating to residential property in Massachusetts. 	 RESPONDENT  Kennan Startzell is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage loan originator under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage loan originator license, license number MLO41311, to Kennan Startzell to engage in the business of a mortgage loan originator on or about September 23, 2008.  Based upon information and belief, from July 2003 to February 2007, Kennan Startzell was employed by, or associated with, East Coast Equity, LLC (""East Coast Equity"" or the ""Company""), a then-licensed mortgage broker in Massachusetts, to originate residential mortgage loan applications.  During the interim of July 2003 through February 2007, Kennan Startzell was authorized to engage in mortgage broker activities in Massachusetts without maintaining his own mortgage broker license due to his status at the relevant time as employed by, or associated with, East Coast Equity pursuant to the applicable licensing exemption provisions set forth under General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. 	 REGULATORY BACKGROUND  Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8 and General Laws chapter 255F, section 14, as then existing, the Division is authorized to inspect the books, accounts, papers, records, and files of mortgage brokers and mortgage loan originators, respectively, transacting business in Massachusetts to determine compliance with the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, chapter 255F, and any rule, or regulation issued thereunder, and with any law, rule, or regulation applicable to the conduct of the licensed business.  On November 25, 2008, pursuant to its statutory authority, the Division commenced an examination/inspection of the books, accounts, papers, records, and files maintained by East Coast Equity to evaluate the Company's compliance with the laws, regulations, and regulatory bulletins applicable to the conduct of a mortgage broker business in Massachusetts (the ""examination/inspection"").  The Division's Report of Examination/Inspection (the ""Report"") presented the findings of the examination/inspection and alleged significant failures to comply with applicable state and federal laws, rules, regulations, and regulatory bulletins governing the conduct of those engaged in the business of a mortgage broker in Massachusetts.  On or about December 29, 2009, the Division and East Coast Equity agreed to the issuance of a Consent Order, Docket No. 2009-116-CO, by the Commissioner, to address the findings of the Division's Report and pursuant to which East Coast Equity agreed to the immediate surrender of its Massachusetts mortgage broker license and a prohibition from re-application for such license for a stipulated period.  During the examination/inspection of East Coast Equity, the Division's examiners determined that Kennan Startzell, while employed by or associated with, East Coast Equity, prepared mortgage loan applications on behalf of applicants for the purchase and/or refinance of various residential properties, as defined pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, which included false and/or misleading representations of the applicants' income. 	 A. Unfair or Deceptive Acts and Practices: False and/or Misleading Representations of Prospective Borrowers' Income  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(8), states: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker or mortgage lender to falsify income or asset information on a mortgage loan application or mortgage loan documents.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) states: 	 Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1) states, in part: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to make any representation or statement of fact if the representation or statement is false or misleading or has the tendency or capacity to be misleading.  Books and records reviewed by the examiners during the examination/inspection revealed that several of the loan files associated with residential mortgage loan transactions originated by Kennan Startzell contained Uniform Residential Loan Applications, which had been prepared by Kennan Startzell and submitted to the lenders, in which the applicants' reported base employment income differed significantly from the actual income information reflected on other pertinent documentation contained in the loan file. Examples include, but are not limited to the following transactions and documents, as summarized below: 	 Loan # 1172138489. 		 The stated income purchase loan application prepared by Kennan Startzell on behalf of East Coast Equity for a loan which closed on January 12, 2007, stated that the gross monthly base employment income of the applicant, a customer service representative with a health insurer, was $6,250, or $75,000 annually. The loan application also included income information for the applicant's part-time job as a transportation coordinator for a rental car agency which stated that the borrower's part-time income was $4,250 per month, or $51,000 annually. The total combined annual income as set forth in the loan application amounted to $126,000.  Hand-written notes retained in the loan file reflect annual income for the applicant's full-time job of $36,000 with part-time annual income of $15,000. According to information provided by East Coast Equity's president during the examination/inspection, the hand-written notes resulted from a phone conversation with the applicant.  The discrepancy in income amounts between the applicant's income as recorded in the internal, hand-written notes and the income reported on the loan application prepared by Kennan Startzell reveals that the applicant's combined gross annual income was overstated by as much as $75,000.  According to information provided by East Coast Equity during the examination/inspection, the applicant was transitioned from a full documentation loan program to a stated income loan program during the origination of the mortgage loan which was ultimately obtained for the applicant.  Upon inquiry, East Coast Equity's president explained to the Division that the income recorded in the hand-written notes represented the applicant's ""documented income"" and did not include ""unreported income."" If taken as true, there was no information reported on the loan application prepared by Kennan Startzell as to the source or occupation which generated this additional income nor was such amount itemized as ""other income.""  Loan # 2815120024 and 2815120061. 		 The stated income, combination purchase loan applications prepared by Kennan Startzell on behalf of East Coast Equity for loans which closed on January 12, 2006 reported that the gross monthly base employment income of the applicant, an accounts receivable director, was $11,750, or $141,000 annually.  Documentation in the purchase loan file contained a ""Statement of Earnings for the Period Ending 8-20-05"" pay-stub which indicates that the applicant's gross weekly income was $899.49, or $46,773.48 annually.  The discrepancy in income between the income set forth in the applicant's pay-stub and the annual salary reported on the loan application prepared by Kennan Startzell reveals that the applicant's gross income was overstated by approximately $94,260.  Neither the documents and records maintained for this transaction, nor the loan application prepared by Kennan Startzell, contained information which would support the source or amount of this additional income.  Loan #2816070030. 		 The stated income refinance loan application prepared by Kennan Startzell on behalf of East Coast Equity for a loan which closed on July 28, 2006 reported that the gross monthly base employment income of the applicant, an accounts receivable director, was $10,250, or $123,000 annually.  The applicant had purchased the property referenced above on January 12, 2006. The purchase money loan applications for that property had also been prepared by Kennan Startzell and brokered by East Coast Equity (Loan No. 2815120024 and 2815120061 above). Documentation in the original purchase loan file contained a ""Statement of Earnings for the Period Ending 8-20-05"" pay-stub which indicates that the applicant's gross weekly income was $899.49, or $46,773.48 annually.  The discrepancy in income between the earnings set forth in the applicant's pay-stub and the annual salary reported on the loan application prepared by Kennan Startzell reveals that the applicant's gross income was overstated by approximately $76,227. The loan file did not include evidence of any change in the applicant's occupation or title during the seven month interim since the time of the applicant's purchase money loan application also prepared by Kennan Startzell which would support this increase in the annual income reported by Kennan Startzell.  Loan #2819110174. 		 The stated income refinance loan application prepared by Kennan Startzell on behalf of East Coast Equity for a loan which closed on November 30, 2006 reported that the gross monthly base employment income of the applicant, an accounts receivable director, was $10,250, or $123,000 annually.  The applicant had purchased the property referenced above on January 12, 2006. The purchase money loan applications for that property, and subsequent refinance loan application, had also been prepared by Kennan Startzell and brokered by East Coast Equity as set forth in subparagraphs 14(b) and 14(c) above. Documentation in the original purchase loan file contained a ""Statement of Earnings for the Period Ending 8-20-05"" pay-stub which indicates that the applicant's gross weekly income was $899.49, or $46,773.48 annually.  The discrepancy in income between the earnings set forth in the applicant's pay-stub and the annual salary reported on the loan application prepared by Kennan Startzell reveals that the applicant's gross income was overstated by approximately $76,227. The loan file did not include evidence of any change in the applicant's occupation or title during the fifteen month interim since the time of the applicant's purchase money loan application also prepared by Kennan Startzell which would support this increase in the annual income reported by Kennan Startzell.  Loan #2815110008. 		 A stated income purchase loan application prepared by Kennan Startzell on behalf of East Coast Equity for a loan which closed on December 5, 2005, reported that the gross monthly base employment income of the applicant, a Director of Business Operations, was $7,150, or $85,800 annually. The gross monthly income of the co-applicant was listed as $3,450 monthly, or $41,400 annually. The total combined income as set forth in the loan application amounted to $127,200.  An annual income statement was submitted by the applicant to Kennan Startzell's attention via facsimile dated November 9, 2005. According to the applicant's statement, the applicant's annual wage income was $42,848 plus $19,728 in social security income and the co-applicant's annual wage income was $16,830 plus $15,180 in social security income. Therefore, according to the information provided by the applicant, the total gross income for both applicants, including social security income, amounted to $94,586.  The discrepancy in income between the total earnings for both applicants set forth in the applicants' annual income statement and the annual salary reported on the stated income loan application prepared by Kennan Startzell, even allowing that social security income was combined with wage income, reveals that the applicants' gross income was overstated by approximately $32,614.  Upon inquiry, East Coast Equity's president explained to the Division that investments produced additional income that was included in the overall gross income. If taken as true, there was no information reported on the loan application prepared by Kennan Startzell as to the source of this additional income nor was such amount itemized as ""other income.""  Kennan Startzell, as a loan originator acting on behalf of East Coast Equity, should have known that the inaccurate and/or misrepresented information he reported as the loan originator of record during the origination and processing of the mortgage loan applications would be relied upon by the mortgage lender or financial institution to which the mortgage loans were brokered by East Coast Equity.  By placing applicants into stated income mortgage loan programs based upon inaccurate and/or misrepresented income information, Kennan Startzell was able to obtain commissions for originating the mortgage loans, which may not have been obtainable if the applicants' actual income had been accurately reported to the lender or financial institution and considered in underwriting the mortgage loans. 	 VIOLATIONS  NOW, THEREFORE, the Division hereby sets forth the following Charges against Kennan Startzell:  The Division hereby re-alleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 16 of this Order and Notice as though fully set forth.

CHARGE TWO:  B  y  falsifying and/or misrepresenting applicants' income information on Uniform Residential Loan Applications submitted to mortgage lenders and financial institutions, Kennan Startzell has violated the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(8), Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) and the Office of the Attorney General's implementing regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1).  CHARGE THREE : Had the foregoing been known to the Division at the time of Kennan Startzell's mortgage loan originator license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 16 present sufficient grounds for the revocation of Kennan Startzell's mortgage loan originator license pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 11(a) and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 41.10(21) and the issuance of an order prohibition pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 11(d) 	 ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE  WHEREAS, finding it necessary and appropriate and in the public interest, and consistent with the purposes of the laws governing licensed mortgage brokers and loan originators in the Commonwealth;  WHEREAS, Pursuant to General Laws chapter 255F, section 11(d), the Commissioner may issue a written notice of intention to prohibit a person from any further actions, in any manner, as a mortgage loan originator or to prohibit the person from being employed by, as agent of, or operating on behalf of a licensee under chapter 255E or 255F or any other business which requires a license from the Commissioner; and  WHEREAS, finding that the Charges set forth above, if found to be true and correct, form the legal basis for the action sought to be taken under General Laws chapter 255F, sections 11(a) and 11(d).

A. FAILURE TO DEMONSTRATE THE FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY, CHARACTER, REPUTATION, INTEGRITY, AND GENERAL FITNESS TO MAINTAIN A FOREIGN TRANSMITTAL AGENCY LICENSE  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169, section 12 relevant to the licensing of foreign transmittal agencies states: 	 The commissioner may suspend or revoke any license issued pursuant to this chapter if he finds that: (a) the licensee has violated any provision of this chapter or any rule or regulation adopted hereunder or any other law applicable to the conduct of such business; or (b) any fact or condition exists which, if it had existed at the time of the original application for such license, would have warranted the commissioner to refuse to issue such license.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 44.04(2)(b) states, in part: 	 (b) The Commissioner may deny such an application [to engage in the business of a foreign transmittal agency] if the Applicant has:  1. violated any provision of M.G.L. c. 169 or 209 CMR 44.00;  2. violated or engaged in a pattern of violations of any state or federal law applicable to the conduct of the business of a foreign transmittal agency...P>  i. Failure to Transmit Funds  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169, section 8 states, in part: 	 All money received for transmission to a foreign country by any licensee shall be forwarded to the person to whom the same is directed within seven days following receipt thereof…  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 44.10 states: 	 Grounds for license revocation under M.G.L. c. 169, § 12 and the issuance of cease and desist orders under M.G.L. c. 169, § 13 shall include, but are not limited to, the following prohibited acts and practices by Licensees:  (5) failing to forward all money received for transmission to a foreign country to the person to whom the same is directed within seven days following receipt thereof.  On or about February 3, 2010, the Division became aware that Pronto Envios failed to transmit funds received by the Corporation's Agents for at least two transactions to beneficiaries in foreign countries within seven days following the receipt thereof.  On December 14, 2009, an authorized agent of the Corporation located in Lawrence, Massachusetts received funds for transmission through Pronto Envios in the amount of one hundred ($100.00) dollars on behalf of a Massachusetts consumer, (""Consumer A"") and provided instructions to Pronto Envios to transmit those funds to a beneficiary located in the Dominican Republic.  On December 14, 2009, an authorized agent of the Corporation located in Lawrence, Massachusetts received funds for transmission through Pronto Envios in the amount of one hundred eighty ($180.00) dollars on behalf of a Massachusetts consumer, (""Consumer B"") and provided instructions to Pronto Envios to transmit those funds to a beneficiary located in the Dominican Republic.  Based upon information and belief, Pronto Envios failed to transmit the funds received from Consumer A and Consumer B to the designated beneficiaries located in the Dominican Republic, and those funds were retained by the Corporation.  Based upon information and belief, the authorized agent, at its own expense, thereafter transmitted funds on behalf of Consumer A and Consumer B through another licensed Foreign Transmittal Agency subsequent to receiving notification that the funds were not received by the beneficiaries.  Based upon information and belief as of the date of this Temporary Order, Pronto Envios failed to forward money received for transmittal to foreign countries. It is unknown how many Massachusetts consumers have been affected by Pronto Envios' failure to transmit such funds, or if the practice is continuing to date. 	 ii. Failure to Timely Disclose Regulatory Actions  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169, section 6 relevant to the licensing and renewal of such license of foreign transmittal agencies states in part: 	 ...Each application for a license shall be accompanied by an investigation fee to be determined annually by the commissioner of administration under the provisions of section three B of chapter seven. Said commissioner may reject an application for a license or an application for a renewal of a license if he finds that the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity and general fitness of the applicant and the members thereof if such applicant is a partnership or association, and of the officers and directors if the applicant is a corporation are not such as to warrant belief that the business will be operated in accordance with law and in the public interest.  On March 6, 2006, the State of California, Department of Financial Institutions issued a Cease and Desist Order pursuant to Financial Code Section 1818 (""Cease and Desist"") against Pronto Envios.  On May 1, 2006, the Division received Pronto Envios' 2007 Foreign Transmittal License Renewal Application (""2007 License Renewal Application""), which was completed and signed by the Corporation as required pursuant to the Division's licensing requirements.  Question 10 of the 2007 License Renewal Application, signed under the pains and penalties of perjury, asked the following question: ""In the past twelve (12) months, has any governmental or regulatory agency ever initiated an informal or formal regulatory action or order against the applicant, or any of its parent companies subsidiaries, affiliates, senior officers (including the location manager(s)), directors, principal stockholders/partners, or beneficiaries (of a trust)?"" The answer to the question provided by Pronto Envios on the License Renewal Application was ""No.""  On May 2, 2007, the New Hampshire Banking Department issued an Order to Show Cause (""Order to Show Cause""), Case Number 07-067 against Pronto Envios. The Order to Show Cause alleged that the Corporation had engaged in unlicensed activity prior to licensure in New Hampshire.  On May 14, 2007, the Division received Pronto Envios' 2008 Foreign Transmittal License Renewal Application (""2008 License Renewal Application""), which was completed and signed by the Corporation as required pursuant to the Division's licensing requirements.  Question 10 of the 2008 License Renewal Application, signed under the pains and penalties of perjury, asked the following question: ""In the past twelve (12) months, has any governmental or regulatory agency ever initiated an informal or formal regulatory action or order against the applicant, or any of its parent companies subsidiaries, affiliates, senior officers (including the location manager(s)), directors, principal stockholders/partners, or beneficiaries (of a trust)?"" The answer to the question provided by Pronto Envios on the License Renewal Application was ""No.""  On June 6, 2007, Pronto Envios and the New Hampshire Banking Department entered into a Consent Agreement, Case Number 07-067 to resolve the matters alleged in the Order to Show Cause.  On April 29, 2009, the Division received Pronto Envios' 2009 Foreign Transmittal License Renewal Application (""License Renewal Application""), which indicated that the Corporation had been subject to a regulatory action. The Corporation answered question 10 on the License Renewal Application in the affirmative and disclosed the New Hampshire Banking Department Order approximately twenty-two (22) months subsequent to its issuance.  On January 15, 2010, the State of Connecticut Department of Banking (""Connecticut Banking Department"") issued a Temporary Order to Cease and Desist, (""Order"") against Pronto Envios for violations of Connecticut laws including a failure to remit funds as required and failure to notify the Connecticut Banking Department of both the California and the New Hampshire Banking Department Orders.  As of the date of this Temporary Order, Pronto Envios has not notified the Division of the Cease and Desist order issued by the State of California, Department of Financial Institutions and the Order issued by the Connecticut Banking Department. 	 Conclusions of Law  Based on the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 26, Pronto Envios has failed to demonstrate the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the business will operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169, section 6, the Division's regulation 209 CMR 44.03, and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 44.04.  Based on the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 26, Pronto Envios, failed to transmit funds received for transmissions to a foreign country within seven days of receipt thereof in violation of M.G.L. chapter 169 section 8 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 44.10(5).  Based on the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 26, by failing to disclose the Regulatory Actions issued by both the California Department of Financial Institutions and New Hampshire Banking Department through the license renewal application, during the relevant time Pronto Envios has failed to demonstrate the character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169 section 6.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 26, the public interest will be harmed by delay in issuing an Order to Cease and Desist under General Laws chapter 169, section 13(b) because, upon information and belief, Pronto Envios' failure to transmit money collected for transmittal to foreign countries here and in Connecticut may be a continuing practice, possibly affecting a growing number of Massachusetts consumers.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 26, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 Pronto Envios has engaged, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that the Corporation is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a foreign transmittal agency including, but not limited to, the provisions under General Laws chapter 169 and the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 44.00  et seq .  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to Pronto Envios.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 26, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of Pronto Envios' original foreign transmittal agency license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. 	 ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that Pronto Envios, any and all officers, directors, employees, independent contractors, or agents operating on behalf of Pronto Envios, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging directly or indirectly in the business of a foreign transmittal agency in Massachusetts, as defined in M.G.L. chapter 169, section 1.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Within two (2) days of the effective date of this TEMPORARY ORDER Pronto Envios shall submit to the Commissioner: 	 A detailed record, prepared as of the date of submission, of the Corporation's accounting of the number and amount of Massachusetts transactions as of December 1, 2009 through the date of submission, including but not limited to, transactions that were processed, including those transactions that were paid out, cancelled, voided, and/or reissued through another licensed money transmitter or remain unresolved.  A detailed record, prepared as of the date of submission, of all of the Corporation's authorized agents' accounting of any monetary damages caused to any Massachusetts consumers or any intended recipient of monies or monetary value received for transmission as a result of Pronto Envios failure to remit funds, including but not limited to, any late charges incurred or penalties imposed on accounts.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Temporary Order shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless set aside, limited or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review pursuant to General Laws chapter 30A.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such Temporary Order shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from the Licensee within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this Temporary Order. If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this Temporary Order shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MOTOR VEHICLE SALES  FINANCE COMPANY  LICENSING  Docket No. 2009-11-OTSC  ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE  AND NOTICE OF INTENT  TO REVOKE MOTOR  VEHICLE SALES FINANCE  COMPANY LICENSE  In the Matter of  FAFAMA AUTO SALES, INC.  Hopedale, Massachusetts  Motor Vehicle Sales Finance Company License No. MV0548  ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLAINT  The Commonwealth of Massachusetts Division of Banks (the ""Division""), by and through the Commissioner of Banks of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the ""Commissioner  "") , for its Order to Show Cause and Notice of Right to a Hearing (""Order and Notice""), alleges as follows:  The Division brings this action under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255B, section 8 to revoke Fafama Auto Sales, Inc.'s (""Fafama"" or the ""Corporation"") motor vehicle sales finance company license MV0548 and to obtain other equitable relief as may be necessary due to Fafama's failure to comply with the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255B and failure to maintain and exercise the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity and general fitness to command the confidence of the public and to warrant the belief that the motor vehicle finance business will be operated lawfully, honestly and fairly, in violation of Massachusetts General Laws, chapter 255B, section 2 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 20.03.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE  The Division is an agency of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts with jurisdiction over matters relating to the licensing and regulation of those engaged in the business of a motor vehicle sales finance company pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255B, section 2.  At all relevant times, Fafama has been engaged in the business of a motor vehicle sales finance company in Massachusetts.  RESPONDENT  Fafama is, and at all relevant times has been, a corporation conducting business in the Commonwealth with its main office located at 236 South Main Street, Hopedale, Massachusetts.  Fafama is licensed by the Commissioner as a motor vehicle sales finance company under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255B section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a motor vehicle sales finance company license, license number MV0548 on or about November 10, 2006.  REGULATORY BACKGROUND  Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255B, section 3, the Division is authorized to inspect the books, accounts, papers, records, and files of motor vehicle sales finance companies transacting business in Massachusetts to determine compliance with the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255B and any rule, or regulation issued thereunder, and with any law, rule, or regulation applicable to the conduct of the business of a motor vehicle sales finance company.  On October 29, 2007, pursuant to the authority granted under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255B, section 3, the Division commenced an examination/inspection of the books, accounts, papers, records, and files maintained by Fafama to evaluate the Corporation's compliance with the laws and regulations applicable to the conduct of a motor vehicle sales finance company business in Massachusetts (the ""examination/inspection"").  The Division's Report of Examination/Inspection (the ""Report""), issued to Fafama on October 6, 2008, alleged significant failures to comply with applicable state and federal laws, rules and regulations governing the conduct of those engaged in the business of a motor vehicle sales finance company in Massachusetts. The findings and conclusions of the Report are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference.  On February 27, 2009, the Commissioner and Fafama entered into a Stipulation and Consent to the Issuance of a Consent Order, and the Consent Order was issued by the Commissioner, Docket No. 2009-11, (the ""Consent Order"") to address the matters raised by the findings of the Report. The Consent Order is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.  A. Failure to Comply with the Terms of the Consent Order  Fafama failed to provide required documentation, within the time-frames set forth in the Consent Order; such documentation included, but was not limited to, evidence of the payment of required monetary reimbursements to consumers. As a result, the Division was compelled to reach out to Fafama on numerous occasions in an attempt to obtain the information. In response to the Division's repeated requests, Fafama submitted information to the Division in piecemeal fashion, constituting partial compliance with the Consent Order. Fafama's final submission was received by the Division on or about August 10, 2009. Despite the Division's subsequent attempts to work with Fafama to achieve Fafama's full compliance with the Consent Order, including a visitation by Division examiners to Fafama's office location on September 14, 2009, Fafama has failed to comply fully with the provisions of the Consent Order, as further set forth below.  Section 20 of the Consent Order states:  Failure to comply with the terms of this Order shall constitute grounds for license suspension and/or revocation pursuant to applicable provisions of the General Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  Section 18 of the Consent Order states:  Nothing in this Order shall be construed as permitting Fafama to violate any law, rule, regulation, or regulatory bulletin to which Fafama is subject.

(a) Fafama shall conduct a review of all late charges assessed by the Corporation on or after January 1, 2005, and shall reimburse all consumers from whom a late charge was collected that was in excess of five percent of each installment or five dollars, whichever is less and/or which was assessed before fifteen days. The amount of such reimbursements shall equal the amounts collected as delinquency charges that were in excess of the amount allowed by statute. In instances where a late charge was assessed before the expiration of the fifteen (15) day period required by M.G.L. chapter 255B, section 11, the Corporation shall reimburse the consumers for the entire amount of the late fee collected. (b) .... Within sixty (60) days of the effective date of this Order, the Auditing Firm shall submit to the Division evidence of all reimbursements issued  .... Evidence of reimbursements issued shall include the consumers' names, account numbers, the amount of reimbursements and the manner in which the reimbursements were calculated, and sufficient evidence to illustrate the credits and/or refunds to each consumer. [Emphasis supplied.]  To date, Fafama has failed to provide evidence of reimbursements issued to consumers for late charges collected in excess of the amount permitted by applicable law and, upon information and belief, Fafama has failed to reimburse such consumers as required under Section 5 of the Consent Order.  (ii) Failure to reimburse consumers for amounts collected for returned check fees that exceeded the amount permitted by M.G.L. chapter 255B, section 11.  Section 6 of the Consent Order states, in part:  Fafama shall establish, implement and maintain policies and procedures to ensure that the Corporation properly assesses and collects returned check fees, where the contract so provides, in amounts not to exceed ten dollars for any check, draft or order for the payment of money submitted in accordance with said contract which is returned unpaid or not honored by a bank or other depository, in accordance with M.G.L. c 255B, section 11... (a) Fafama shall conduct a review of all returned check fees assessed by the Corporation on or after January 1, 2005 and shall reimburse all consumers from whom a returned check fee in excess of ten dollars was collected. The amount of such reimbursements shall equal the amounts collected as returned check fees that were in excess of the amount allowed by statute. (b).... Within sixty (60) days of the effective date of this Order, the Auditing Firm shall submit to the Division evidence of all reimbursements issued .... Evidence of reimbursements issued shall include the consumers' names, account numbers, the amount of reimbursements and the manner in which the reimbursements were calculated, and sufficient evidence to illustrate the credits and/or refunds to each consumer. [Emphasis supplied.]  To date, Fafama has failed to provide evidence of reimbursements issued to consumers for amounts collected as returned check fees in excess of ten dollars and, upon information and belief, Fafama has failed to reimburse such consumers as required under Section 6 of the Consent Order.  (iii) Failure to reimburse consumers for amounts collected as finance charges that were in excess of the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) permitted under M.G.L. chapter 255B, section 14  Section 7 of the Consent Order states, in part:  Fafama shall establish, implement and maintain policies and procedures to ensure that the Corporation does not charge, receive, and collect a finance charge in excess of an annual percentage rate (APR) of twenty-one per cent, inclusive of all charges incident to investigating and making the contract and for the extension of the credit provided for in the contract, in accordance with M.G.L. chapter 255B, section 14....(a) Fafama shall conduct a review of the APR charged on all loan accounts since January 1, 2005 and shall reimburse all consumers who were charged an APR in excess of 21%. The amount of such reimbursements shall equal the total amounts collected as finance charges that were in excess of the APR permitted by M.G.L. chapter 255B, section 14 . (b) .... Within sixty (60) days of the effective date of this Order, the Auditing Firm shall submit to the Division evidence of all reimbursements issued.... Evidence of reimbursements issued shall include the consumers' names, account numbers, the amount of reimbursements and the manner in which the reimbursements were calculated, and sufficient evidence to illustrate the credits and/or refunds to each consumer. [Emphasis supplied.]  To date, Fafama has failed to provide evidence of reimbursements issued to consumers for amounts collected as finance charges that were in excess of the APR permitted by statute and, upon information and belief, Fafama has failed to reimburse such consumers as required under Section 7 of the Consent Order.  (iv)Failure to reimburse consumers for repossession fees collected in excess of reasonable expenses incurred by Fafama  Section 8 of the Consent Order states, in part:  Fafama shall establish, implement and maintain policies and procedures to ensure that, in instances where the consumer pays the full amount of debt in order to regain possession of collateral repossessed by the Corporation, Fafama charges consumers only for reasonable expenses incurred upon the Corporation's taking possession of the collateral. For the purposes of this Order, ""Reasonable Expense"" is defined as the amount charged to the Corporation by the repossession agent. (a) Fafama shall conduct a review of loan accounts since January 1, 2005 in which the collateral was repossessed and then returned to the consumer upon payment of the default and shall reimburse the consumers for all repossession fees that were in excess of the amount charged to Fafama by the repossession agent. (b) .... Within sixty (60) days of the effective date of this Order, the Auditing Firm shall submit to the Division evidence of all reimbursements issued .... Evidence of reimbursements issued shall include the consumers' names, account numbers, the amount of reimbursements and the manner in which the reimbursements were calculated, and sufficient evidence to illustrate the credits and/or refunds to each consumer. [Emphasis supplied.]  To date, Fafama has failed to conduct a review of loan accounts in which the collateral was repossessed and then returned to the consumer upon payment of the default and has failed to reimburse consumers for repossession fees that were in excess of the amount charged to Fafama by the repossession agent.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE LOAN  ORIGINATOR LICENSING  Docket No. 2010-199-MLO  FINDINGS OF FACT AND  TEMPORARY ORDER TO  CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  JEFFREY PAUL CHALMERS, Individually  Mortgage Loan Originator License No.: MLO76803  and  REAL SOLUTIONS, LLC  Norfolk, Massachusetts  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that JEFFREY PAUL CHALMERS (""Jeffrey Chalmers""), has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 41.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""Temporary Order"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255F, section 11(a).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage loan originator in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 2 and its implementing regulation at 209 CMR 41.00  et seq .  The Division, through the Commissioner, also has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2 and its implementing regulation at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq .  Jeffrey Chalmers is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage loan originator under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage loan originator license, license number MLO76803, to Jeffrey Chalmers to engage in the business of a mortgage loan originator on or about October 31, 2008.  A review of records available through the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System (""NMLS"") indicate that Jeffrey Chalmers is not licensed as a mortgage loan originator in any other state.  A. Unlicensed Mortgage Broker Activity  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1 defines a mortgage broker as:  Any person who for compensation or gain, or in the expectation of compensation or gain, directly or indirectly negotiates, places, assists in placement, finds or offers to negotiate, place, assist in placement or find mortgage loans on residential property for others.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2 states in part:  No person shall act as a mortgage broker or mortgage lender with respect to residential property unless first obtaining a license from the commissioner;  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.04 (1) states:  It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to make any representation or statement of fact in an advertisement if the representation or statement is false or misleading or has the tendency or capacity to be misleading, or if the mortgage broker or lender does not have sufficient information upon which a reasonable belief in the truth of the representation or statement could be based.  On or about March 4, 2010, the Division's Consumer Assistance Unit received an inquiry from a Massachusetts consumer regarding the licensing status of Real Solutions, LLC and the Division subsequently reviewed information that indicated that Jeffrey Chalmers was operating as a mortgage broker through Real Solutions, LLC.  The Division's review of information available through the Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth's Corporations Division (""Corporations Division"") website, indicates that Jeffrey Chalmers was the manager of Real Solutions, LLC. Real Solutions, LLC was incorporated in the Commonwealth on or about January 15, 2005 and information reviewed on the Corporations Division's website indicates that Real Solutions, LLC was dissolved by court order on or about April 30, 2009. Real Solutions is not permitted to carry on any business in the Commonwealth pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 156C, section 70.  The Division's review of the Real Solutions, LLC website maintained by Jeffrey Chalmers at  www.clickncompare.com  indicates that Mr. Chalmers is currently soliciting and/or accepting mortgage loan applications from Massachusetts consumers through the website. Additionally, information available on the website indicates Real Solutions, LLC maintains three office locations in Norfolk, Massachusetts; Bristol, New Hampshire; and Providence, Rhode Island.  The Division's review of a ""rate sheet"" available online at www.dailyrates.info as of April 26, 2010, revealed that Jeffrey Chalmers identified himself as a senior mortgage consultant for Real Solutions, LLC. The ""rate sheet"" also contained a Massachusetts mortgage broker license number which is legally and exclusively associated with Cooper & Shein LLC a company at which Jeffrey Chalmers had previously been employed. The ""rate sheet"" failed to identify Cooper & Shein LLC by name and had the tendency to indicate that the license number was affiliated with Real Solutions, LLC. (See  Exhibit 1  , attached hereto and incorporated by reference).  B. Engaging in Unauthorized Mortgage Loan Originator Activity  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 41.06(3) states in part:  When the relationship between the Employing Entity and the Mortgage Loan Originator is terminated, the license shall become inactive and the Mortgage Loan Originator shall not be authorized to engage in any residential mortgage loan origination activity unless and until the Mortgage Loan Originator's license has been re-assigned to another Entity and all Division procedures have been followed to re-assign and reactivate such license.  As a result of the events referenced in paragraphs 8 through 11 of this Temporary Order, on or about April 7, 2010, the Division conducted a visitation of Real Solutions, LLC's Norfolk office location to discuss the concerns raised by the Division's review of the information reflected on the ""rate sheet"" and the website maintained by Jeffrey Chalmers.  In response to the Division's concerns, Mr. Chalmers indicated that he retained the name of Real Solutions, LLC as a marketing tool, and routed all loan applications received through  www.clickncompare.com  to Cooper and Shein, LLC. A review of the website failed to include any reference to Cooper and Shein, LLC.  The Division's licensing records indicate that as of March 30, 2010, Jeffrey Chalmers was in an ""inactive"" status and his sponsorship with Cooper and Shein, LLC had been terminated.  The Division's records indicate that Real Solutions, LLC has never applied to the Division to obtain a license to do business as a mortgage lender and/or broker in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  As of the date of this Temporary Order, the website maintained by Jeffrey Chalmers continues to be operational and consumers may still apply for a mortgage loan through the website.  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 17, Jeffrey Chalmers has failed to demonstrate and maintain the character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that Jeffrey Chalmers, as a licensed mortgage loan originator will act honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 4 and the Division's regulations 209 CMR 41.04(2)(d).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 17, by negotiating, placing, assisting in placement, finding or offering to negotiate, place, assist in placement or finding mortgage loans on residential property for others with the expectation of compensation or gain, without obtaining a mortgage broker license, Jeffrey Chalmers has violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2 Division's regulations 209 CMR 42.00  et seq .  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 17, by maintaining a website that contained false or misleading language or had the tendency to be false or misleading, Jeffrey Chalmers has violated the Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.04(1)  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 17, by acting in the capacity of a mortgage loan originator while in an inactive status, Jeffrey Chalmers has violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 4(b) and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 41.06(3).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 17, the Commissioner has determined that:  Jeffrey Chalmers has engaged in, is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that it is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage loan originator including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 41.00 et seq.; and  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to Jeffrey Chalmers.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 17, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of Jeffrey Chalmers' original mortgage loan originator license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 17 present sufficient grounds for the revocation of Jeffrey Chalmers' mortgage loan originator license pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 11 and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 41.10(21).  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that Jeffrey Chalmers, Real Solutions, LLC and any and all officers, members, managers, employees, independent contractors, or agents, operating on behalf of Real Solutions, LLC, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of a mortgage broker, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts. Therefore, Real Solutions, LLC is ordered to immediately cease soliciting or accepting, either directly or indirectly, any residential mortgage loan applications from consumers for residential property located in Massachusetts.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Jeffrey Chalmers shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of a mortgage loan originator, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Temporary Order.

Jeffrey Chalmers shall obtain the prior approval of the Commissioner before placing such applications to the qualified broker(s) or lender(s).  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Jeffrey Chalmers and Real Solutions, LLC shall submit to the Commissioner a detailed record, prepared as of the date of submission, of all of the pending residential mortgage loan applications on property located in Massachusetts.

The latter list should include telephone numbers of contact persons familiar with Jeffrey Chalmers and Real Solutions, LLC submitted loans.

Jeffrey Chalmers shall submit payment of all costs associated with the investigation/inspection of the aforementioned matter as set forth in the relevant invoice issued to Jeffrey Chalmers. The payment shall be made payable to the ""Commonwealth of Massachusetts"" and mailed to Division of Banks, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 1000 Washington Street, 10  th  Floor, Boston Massachusetts 02118-6400 within 30 days of receipt of the invoice.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Temporary Order shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 30A.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Temporary Order shall not be construed as approving any act, practice, or conduct not specifically set forth herein which was, is, or may be in violation of relevant state or federal laws and regulations.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such Temporary Order shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from Jeffrey Chalmers within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this Temporary Order. If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this Temporary Order shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE LENDER AND  MORTGAGE BROKER  LICENSING  Docket No. 2010-001  FINDINGS OF FACT AND  TEMPORARY ORDER TO  CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  FIRST OHIO BANC & LENDING, INC.  Independence, Ohio  Mortgage Company License No.: MC3973  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that FIRST OHIO BANC & LENDING, INC., (""First Ohio Banc"" or the ""Corporation""), located at 6100 Rockside Woods Boulevard, Independence, Ohio, has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""Temporary Order"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b) and chapter 255F, section 11(a).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  The Division, through the Commissioner, also has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons engaged in the business of a mortgage loan originator in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 2 and its implementing regulation 209 CMR 41.00  et seq .  First Ohio Banc is, and at all relevant times, has been a foreign corporation conducting business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts First Ohio Banc's main office is located at 6100 Rockside Woods Boulevard, Independence, Ohio.  First Ohio Banc is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage lender and mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner issued a mortgage company license; license number MC3973, to First Ohio Banc to engage in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker on or about June 22, 2005. License number MC3973 authorized First Ohio Banc to conduct the mortgage company business from the Corporation's main office located at 6100 Rockside Woods Boulevard, Independence, Ohio.  Mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers in Massachusetts are licensed and regulated under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, which is administered and enforced by the Commissioner. Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division is authorized to inspect the books, accounts, papers, records, and files of mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers transacting business in Massachusetts to determine compliance with the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E or any rule, or regulation issued thereunder, and with any law, rule, or regulation applicable to the conduct of the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker.  On September 21, 2009, pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division commenced an examination/inspection of the books, accounts, papers, records, and files maintained by First Ohio Banc to evaluate the Corporation's compliance with the laws, regulations, and regulatory bulletins applicable to the conduct of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker business in Massachusetts (the ""2009 examination/inspection""). The analysis of the books and records that were reviewed relative to the 2009 examination/inspection continued until an exit meeting was held with First Ohio Banc on April 22, 2010.  The Division's Report of Examination/Inspection on Consumer Compliance (the ""Report""), which was issued to First Ohio Banc on the effective date of this Temporary Order, presented the findings of the 2009 examination/inspection and alleged significant failures to comply with applicable state and federal laws, rules, regulations, and regulatory bulletins governing the conduct of those engaged in the business of a mortgage broker and mortgage lender in Massachusetts. 	 A. False and/or Misleading Representations of Prospective Borrowers' Income  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(8), effective as of September 8, 2006, states: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker of mortgage lender to falsify income or asset information on a mortgage loan application or mortgage loan documents.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) states: 	 Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1) states, in part: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to make any representation or statement of fact if the representation or statement is false or misleading or has the tendency or capacity to be misleading.  The 2009 examination/inspection revealed that First Ohio Banc falsified or misrepresented income information on mortgage loan documents relating to loans originated by the Corporation. Examples include, but are not limited to the following documents, as summarized below: 	 Loan #11779329. 		 A loan application for a loan originated by Lee Bachman and signed by the applicant as of November 8, 2006 indicated that the gross monthly base employment income of the applicant, was $2,900 or $34,800 annually.  A final loan application completed as of November 24, 2006, reflects an increase in the applicant's gross monthly income to $3,400, or $40,800 annually.  A copy of a Verification of Employment (""VOE"") form maintained in the loan file provided by the Corporation for review reflected a year to date income through November 4, 2006 of $17,991. The VOE reflected an hourly wage of $9.81 and the average hours per week as 40-45 which when aggregated indicated that the applicant earned approximately $1,912.95 monthly or $22,955.40 annually if the applicant had worked the maximum 45 hours a week.  The discrepancy in income reflected on the loan application signed at closing and the VOE form maintained in the loan file reveals an overstatement of the applicant's gross annual income of approximately $17,845.  Loan #124010292. 		 A final loan application for a loan originated by Allen Pesci, for a loan which closed on August 14, 2006 indicated that the gross monthly base employment income of the applicant, a senior lead auto glass technician, was $8,969, monthly or $107,628 annually.  A pay stub maintained in the loan file for the pay period for the week of June 11, 2006 reflected a payment of $760.00 for the week which would project a gross base monthly income of $3,293, or $39,520 annually.  A copy of the applicant's ""online banking activity"" form maintained in the loan file reflected a payroll deposit of $578.90 on June 4, 2006.  A copy of a ""Client Information Sheet"" maintained in the loan file indicated that the borrower's income from the same employer as that reported on the 1003 loan application was $41,000.  The discrepancy in income reflected on the loan application and the paystub maintained in the loan file reveals an overstatement of the applicant's gross annual income of approximately $68,108.  A review of Registry of Deeds records indicates that a foreclosure deed was filed on April 17, 2008.  Loan #0124329420. 		 A loan application for a loan originated by Mike Nader and completed as of July 1, 2006 for a loan which closed on September 7, 2006 indicated that the gross monthly base employment income of the applicant, a customer service representative was $5,688.14 monthly or $68,257.68 annually.  The final application signed at closing reflected the applicant's gross monthly income to $4,900 monthly, or $58,800 annually.  A copy of an ""Initial Interview Sheet"" maintained in the loan file reviewed by the Division's examiner reflected the applicant's hourly wage as $10 per hour and a yearly income of $20,800.  The discrepancy in income reflected on the final loan application and the Initial Interview Sheet in the loan file reveals an overstatement of the applicant's gross annual income of approximately $38,000.  A review of the loan file provided for review indicated that there was nothing maintained in the loan file that would indicate or support the source or occupation generating additional income to determine its accuracy, nor was any information reflected under the additional income section of the 1003 loan application as required, if the additional income was generated from the applicant's employment as a customer service representative above the borrower's base salary.  A review of the Registry of Deeds records indicate that foreclosure proceedings were initiated on or about April 8, 2008 and the property was ultimately foreclosed upon on or about August 27, 2008.  First Ohio Banc knew or should have known that the above referenced income and/or asset information would be relied upon by the mortgage lender, financial institution or investor to which the mortgage loans were brokered and/or sold by First Ohio Banc. 	 B. Undisclosed Fees  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 183, section 63 states, in part: 	 A mortgagee, or a mortgage lender or mortgage broker as defined in section one of chapter two hundred and fifty-five E, shall not charge a loan fee, finder's fee, points, so-called, or similar fees in a mortgage transaction involving residential property located in the commonwealth of four or less units and occupied in whole or in part by the mortgagor, except to the extent that such fees or points have been previously disclosed to the mortgagor in writing, which disclosure may be in the form required by section seventeen D of chapter one hundred and eighty-four, or such other form which discloses said fees or points. A mortgagor shall not be obligated to pay fees or points which have not been previously disclosed as required herein.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2009 examination/inspection indicate, as more fully described in the Report, that First Ohio Banc engaged in a pattern or practice of collecting fees that were not previously disclosed to the mortgagor in writing. 	 C. Conducting Residential Mortgage Loan Business in Massachusetts with Unlicensed Mortgage Loan Originators  Effective July 31, 2009, Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 2(a), states, in part: (Effective July 1, 2008 until July 31, 2009, M.G.L. chapter 255F, section 2 stated: ""No person shall act as a mortgage loan originator unless such person has first obtained a mortgage loan originator license from the commissioner. An entity shall not knowingly employ or retain a mortgage loan originator unless the mortgage loan originator is licensed under this chapter."") 	 No individual shall act as a mortgage loan originator with respect to any dwelling unless such person has first obtained a mortgage loan originator license from the commissioner or is exempt from the licensure requirement . . . No person shall knowingly employ or retain a mortgage loan originator unless the mortgage loan originator is licensed under this chapter or is exempt from the licensure requirement.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F section 11(e) states: 	 The commissioner may suspend, revoke or refuse to renew the license of the entity employing any licensed mortgage originator upon finding that: (i) the entity knew or reasonably should have known that the mortgage loan originator violated this chapter or any rule or regulation promulgated hereunder, or any other law applicable to the conduct of its business; (ii) the entity knew of any fact or condition which, if it had existed at the time of the original application for such license, would have warranted the commissioner in refusing to issue such license; or (iii) the mortgage loan originator committed any fraud, misappropriated funds or misrepresented any of the material particulars of a mortgage loan transaction approved by the entity.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(17) states: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker or a mortgage lender to conduct business with an individual who should be licensed as a mortgage loan originator under M.G.L. c. 255F, and who the mortgage broker or mortgage lender knows or should know is an unlicensed mortgage loan originator.  Books and records reviewed during the 2009 examination/inspection revealed that fifty-two residential mortgage loan applications were originated by fifteen unlicensed individuals on behalf of First Ohio Banc between September 3, 2008 and October 6, 2009. 	 D. Engaging in the Mortgage Lender and Mortgage Broker Business in Massachusetts from Unlicensed Locations  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 5 states in part: 	 Each [mortgage broker/mortgage lender] license shall state the address at which the business is to be conducted and shall state the name of the licensee. If a licensee intends to carry on such business at any place in addition to the address on the license, he shall so notify the commissioner, in writing, at least 30 days prior thereto.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.13(1) states: 	 A Licensee who intends to carry on its business at any location in addition to the address on its original license shall notify the Commissioner, in writing, at least 30 days prior to the opening of the branch location. Such notice shall contain the address of any such place and such other information as the Commissioner may require.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2009 examination/inspection indicate that, beginning on a date that is unknown to the Division and continuing at least until the date of the 2009 examination/inspection, First Ohio Banc conducted its mortgage lender and mortgage broker business at seven office locations, for which First Ohio Banc failed to provide prior notice to the Commissioner, submit a branch license application, or receive approval from the Commissioner to engage in the mortgage lender and mortgage broker business from such locations.  The seven referenced office locations included locations in WestLake, Ohio; Middleburg Heights, Ohio; Fairlawn, Ohio; Medina, Ohio; two locations in Mentor, Ohio; and Boynton Beach, Florida. 	 E. Excessive Late Charges  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 183, section 59 states in part: 	 A mortgagee, assignee or holder of a mortgage note secured by a first or subordinate lien on a dwelling house of 4 or less separate households or on a residential condominium unit occupied or to be occupied in whole or in part by the mortgagor shall not require the mortgagor to pay a penalty or late charge for any payment paid within 15 days or in the case of a bi-weekly mortgage payment, paid within 10 days, from the date the payment is due.  In no event, in assessing a penalty because of the delinquency in making all or any part of a periodic payment under a mortgage note, shall the penalty or late charge exceed 3 per cent of the amount of principal and interest overdue, and in calculating the penalty or late charge, any amount of the periodic payment representing estimated tax payments required by the terms of the mortgage note or deed shall not be included.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2009 examination/inspection revealed that in at least two loan files reviewed, First Ohio Banc when acting in the capacity of a mortgage lender, provided consumers with a final Truth in Lending Form (""TIL"") that indicated that the late charge to be assessed would be three (3) percent of the total mortgage payment and would include any escrow payments.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2009 examination/inspection revealed that in at least one loan file reviewed, First Ohio Banc provided consumers with a final TIL that reflected a five (5) percent late charge. 	 F. Failure to Provide Consumers with Accurate Variable Rate Loan Program Disclosure  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 32.19(2)(8)(b) states: 	 The maximum interest rate and payment for a $10,000 loan originated at the initial interest rate (index value plus margin, adjusted by the amount of any discount or premium) in effect as of an identified month and year for the loan program disclosure assuming the maximum periodic increases in rates and payments under the program; and the initial interest rate and payment for that loan and a statement that the periodic payment may increase or decrease substantially depending on changes in the rate.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners revealed that in at least two loan files, First Ohio Banc when acting in the capacity of a mortgage lender, failed to complete the Variable Rate Loan Program Disclosure (""Disclosure"") accurately. In one loan file reviewed the Corporation failed to complete a particular section of the Disclosure. A second Disclosure reviewed by the Division's examiners indicated that the interest rate could not increase or decrease more than two percentage points at initial adjustment and would not increase or decrease more than six percentage points over the term of the loan, however a review of the terms of the mortgage indicated that the initial adjustment and the term of the loan could not increase or decrease by more than five percentage points. 	 G. Understated Finance Charges  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 140D, section 5(a) states: 	 The annual percentage rate applicable to any extension of consumer credit shall be determined in accordance with the regulations of the commissioner.  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 32.18(4)(a) states: 	 In a transaction secured by real property or a dwelling, the disclosed finance charge and other disclosures affected by the disclosed finance charge (including the amount financed and the annual percentage rate) shall be treated as accurate if the amount disclosed as the finance charge:  1. is understated by no more than $100; or  2. is greater than the amount required to be disclosed.     Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2009 examination/inspection revealed that in one loan file reviewed, First Ohio Banc when acting in the capacity of a mortgage lender, provided consumers with a final TIL that reflected an understated finance charge. 	 H. Failure to Provide Required Statements and Information  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 184, section 17B states 	 Every application for a mortgage loan on 1-to-4- family residential property and occupied or to be occupied in whole or in part by the obligor on the mortgage debt shall be made on a printed form which shall contain the following 2 statements in type of at least 2 points larger than the other type used on the application:  The responsibility of the attorney for the mortgagee is to protect the interest of the mortgagee.  Mortgagors may, at their own expense, engage an attorney of their selection to represent their interests in the transaction.  A printed copy of the above statements and information shall be given to the mortgagor at the time of making the application.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners revealed that First Ohio Banc when acting in the capacity of a mortgage lender, failed to retain evidence of having provided the required Notice in several loan files reviewed. 	 I. Failure to Disclose License Type and Number  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.15 states: 	 A Licensee shall disclose the type and number of its license(s) to all clients and/or residential mortgage loan applicants in writing at the time a fee is paid or a mortgage loan application is accepted. A Licensee shall also disclose the type and number of its license(s) in all advertisements.  Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.04(2) states, in part: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to advertise without clearly and conspicuously disclosing its business name, the words ""broker"" or ""lender"", as applicable, and the license number.  First Ohio Banc failed to disclose the Corporation's license type and number on the Corporation's website.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners revealed that First Ohio Banc when acting in the capacity of a mortgage lender, failed to retain evidence of having disclosed the Corporation's license type and number at application in at least four loan files reviewed. 	 J. Failure to Provide Required Notices  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 167, section 14A states: 	 Any applicant whose residential mortgage loan application is denied by any mortgagee making five or more mortgage loans in any calendar year on residential property located in the commonwealth of four units or less and occupied in whole or in part by the mortgagor shall be instructed by the mortgagee, in writing, at the time of denial of his right to appeal any such denial to the appropriate mortgage review board.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(12) states: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker or mortgage lender to engage in a pattern or practice of failing to make any disclosure to a consumer required by and at the time specified by any applicable state or federal law, regulation or directive.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners revealed that First Ohio Banc, failed to retain evidence of having provided the Mortgage Review Board Notice in all denied loan files reviewed. 	 K. Loan Origination and Compensation Agreement  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(5) states in part: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker to fail to provide to the consumer at the time of application the loan origination and compensation agreement required under 209 CMR 42.16. The content of the agreement shall strictly conform to 209 CMR 42.16 and include signatures and dates by the consumer(s) and the mortgage broker.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.09(1)(b) states, in part: 	 Each mortgage broker . . . shall retain for a minimum of three years after a mortgage loan is made the following: the original loan origination and compensation agreement as set out in 209 CMR 42.16.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2009 examination/inspection revealed that First Ohio Banc when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker, failed to retain evidence of having provided the Loan Origination and Compensation Agreements in all files reviewed. 	 L. Providing Mortgage Lender Disclosures to Consumers when Acting in the Capacity of a Mortgage Broker  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2009 examination/inspection indicate that First Ohio Banc when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker, routinely provided several mortgage lender disclosures to consumers to consumers in violation of and exceeding its authority under G. L. c. 255E.  The mortgage lender disclosures include, but are not limited to, Equal Credit Opportunity Notice, Notices to Applicant's of Right to Receive Copy of Appraisal Report, Servicing Disclosure, Truth in Lending Disclosure, and Variable Rate Mortgage Program Disclosure. 	 M. Misleading Statements  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1) states, in part: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to make any representation or statement of fact if the representation or statement is false or misleading, or has the tendency or capacity to be misleading.  Books and records reviewed during the 2009 examination/inspection revealed that First Ohio Banc, when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker, provided applicants with a Borrower's Certification and Authorization Form that contained language that was false or misleading or had the tendency or capacity to be false or misleading. Specifically, the Borrower's Certification and Authorization Form contained language which suggests that First Ohio Banc, while acting as the mortgage broker in the transaction, was approving or funding the mortgage loan which, if true, would exceed the authority of the mortgage broker in the transaction. 	 N. Interest Rate Lock Commitments  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(3)(b) states, in part: 	 (b) ...A mortgage broker may only take a rate lock commitment fee for transmittal to the mortgage lender which intends to make the loan. Nothing herein shall prohibit a mortgage broker from negotiating the terms or conditions of a mortgage loan, including the interest rate, on behalf of a consumer. A mortgage broker may also use such forms or other evidence as desired to allow a consumer to indicate a preference to enter into a mortgage rate lock commitment with a mortgage lender. However, any such forms or evidence must clearly and conspicuously contain the following statement: ""This is a request, not a commitment, to lock your interest rate with a mortgage lender"".  The 2009 examination/inspection revealed that when acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker, First Ohio Banc provided consumers with a ""Loan Pricing Agreement Defining Interest Rate and Terms"" (""Form"") which included language that detailed the loan programs requested by the prospective borrowers and locked in a particular interest rate. The Form did not contain the required language, ""This is a request, not a commitment, to lock your interest rate with a mortgage lender."" 	 O. Other Violations  In addition to the violations specifically set forth in this Temporary Order, a Report of Examination/Inspection prepared as of September 21, 2009 and to be provided to First Ohio Banc in conjunction with the issuance of this Temporary Order, describes other violations observed during the 2009 examination/inspection.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE BROKER  LICENSING  Docket No. 2010-227  FINDINGS OF FACT AND  TEMPORARY ORDER TO  CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  PROVIDENCE MORTGAGE CORP.  Providence, Rhode Island  Mortgage Broker License No(s). MB1949  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that PROVIDENCE MORTGAGE CORP. (""Providence Mortgage"" or the ""Licensee""), with its main address located at 345 Hope Street Providence, Rhode Island 02906 has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""Temporary Order"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b) and chapter 255F, section 11(a).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  The Division, through the Commissioner, also has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons engaged in the business of a mortgage loan originator in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 2.  Providence Mortgage is, and at all relevant times has been, a Massachusetts licensed mortgage broker doing business in the Commonwealth. 	 A. Failure to Submit Financial Statements as Required  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.06(2)(b)3 states: 	 Renewal Applications. Within 90 days of the close of its fiscal year, an Applicant for mortgage broker license renewal shall submit financial statements for the preceding fiscal year that have been  audited or reviewed  by an independent certified public accountant and such other financial information as the Commissioner may require. [Emphasis supplied.]  On or about October 22, 2009, the Division sent detailed instructions to all licensed mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders regarding the 2010 license renewal application process.  The license renewal instructions notified each recipient that by December 31, 2009, all mortgage lender and mortgage broker licensees were required to remain in compliance with 209 CMR 42.03 and 209 CMR 42.06, respectively, including the requirement to submit to the Division audited or reviewed financial statements, as determined by the type of license(s) held, within ninety (90) days of the end of a licensee's fiscal year end.  On or about March 16, 2010, the Division sent a reminder notice to all licensed mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders regarding the 2010 license renewal requirements. Pursuant to the instructions contained therein, all licensed mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders with a fiscal year end date of December 31  st  were directed to file through the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System (NMLS) the required financial statements by no later than March 31, 2010.  On March 31, 2010, Providence Mortgage uploaded financial statements through the NMLS that have been prepared on a compilation basis. These financial statements were not in accordance with the 2010 license renewal instructions or the Division's regulation, as they were neither audited nor reviewed by an independent certified public accountant, as required.  As of the date of this Temporary Order, the Licensee has failed to provide the required financial statements to fulfill the Division's license renewal requirements. 	 B. Failure to Submit Annual Report  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8 states, in part: 	 Each licensee shall annually, on or before a date determined by the commissioner, file a report with the commissioner containing such information as said commissioner may require concerning the business and operations conducted by the licensee in the commonwealth during the preceding calendar year.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.10 states: 	 By March 31, each Licensee shall file an annual report with the Commissioner in such form as the Commissioner shall prescribe for the preceding calendar year. The annual report shall be in writing, subscribed by the Licensee under the pains and penalty of perjury.  The license renewal instructions issued by the Division on October 22, 2009 and subsequent reminder notice on March 16, 2010 as described above, also notified all licensed mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders of the requirement that all licensees were required to submit to the Division a completed Mortgage Lender/Mortgage Broker Annual Report for the period ending December 31, 2009 (""Mortgage Lender/Mortgage Broker 2009 Annual Report"") by March 31, 2010. In both sets of instructions, licensees were notified that a $50.00 per calendar day late fee would be assessed to all licensees that failed to submit the Mortgage Lender/Mortgage Broker 2009 Annual Report by March 31, 2010.  On May 20, 2010, the Division received Providence Mortgage's Mortgage Broker 2009 Annual Report, which resulted in the assessment of an annual report late filing fee. As of the date of this Temporary Order, the late fee is still outstanding. 	 C. Failure to File the Massachusetts Foreign Corporation Annual Report  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 156D, section 16.22 states, in part: 	 (a) Each domestic corporation, and each foreign corporation authorized to transact business in the commonwealth, shall deliver to the secretary of state for filing an annual report that sets forth:  (1) the name of the corporation and the state or country under whose law it is incorporated;  (2) the address of its registered office and the name of its registered agent at that office in the commonwealth;  (3) the address of its principal office;  (4) the names and business addresses of its directors, officers required by section 8.40(a), and chief executive officer and chief financial officer, if different;  (5) A brief description of its activities in the commonwealth.  (6) the total number of authorized shares, itemized by class and series, if any, within each class;  (7) the total number of issued and outstanding shares, itemized by class and series, if any, within each class; and  (8) the fiscal year of the corporation.  (b) Information in the annual report shall be current as of the date the annual report is executed on behalf of the corporation.  (c) The annual report shall be delivered to the secretary of state within 2 1/2 months after the end of the fiscal year of the corporation.  The Secretary of the Commonwealth's regulation 950 CMR 113.57(1) states: 	 (1) Each domestic corporation and each foreign corporation authorized to transact business in the commonwealth shall file an annual report with the Division within 2½ months after the close of the corporation's fiscal year end.  The license renewal instructions issued by the Division on October 22, 2009 and March 16, 2010 as described above, also notified all licensed mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders of the requirement that all licensees were required to submit to the Secretary of the Commonwealth the applicable Massachusetts Corporation (or Foreign Corporation) Annual Report (or LLC Annual Report) (collectively, the ""Corporate Annual Report"") within two and one half months of the end of Providence Mortgage's fiscal year end.  As of the date of this Temporary Order, the Licensee has failed to file a 2009 Corporate Annual Report.  On December 31, 2010, Providence Mortgage, through a duly appointed and authorized representative, affirmed a series of attestations in completing the Company's Massachusetts license renewal application through the NMLS (the ""Renewal Attestation""). The Renewal Attestation provided that the licensee acknowledged and agreed to expediently update and correct the information in the licensee's NMLS record as it changed. Providence Mortgage further attested, in part, to an understanding that, ""submitting false or misleading information, or omitting pertinent or material information, may be grounds for administrative action and/or criminal action.""  Providence Mortgage's Renewal Attestation further provided, in part, the following: 	 The Licensee/Registrant remains in good standing with each jurisdiction's Secretary of State office, or other applicable agency, for each jurisdiction being requested to renew its license/registration;  The Licensee/Registrant meets the financial responsibility requirements and/or net worth requirements, as required by each jurisdiction being requested to renew its license/registration; and  The licensee acknowledged an understanding, and agreed to comply with, the laws and regulations pertaining to the conduct of the licensed business.  On or about May 13, 2010, the Division issued a Final Notice to Providence Mortgage, providing notification of the deficiencies with Providence Mortgage's license renewal status and directing Providence Mortgage to comply with the license renewal process by supplying the outstanding renewal requirements identified in paragraph(s) 4 through 19. The directive required the Company to respond with all applicable information by no later than May 24, 2010. As of the date of this Temporary Order, Providence Mortgage has failed to submit all, or part of, the required documentation to the Division. 	 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 20, by failing to file the financial statements that are required pursuant to the license renewal process, Providence Mortgage has violated 209 CMR 42.06(2)(b)3  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 20, by failing to file its Mortgage Broker 2009 Annual Report in a timely manner, Providence Mortgage has violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8 and 209 CMR 42.10.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 20, by failing to file its 2009 Corporate Annual Report, Providence Mortgage has violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 156D, section 16.22 and 950 CMR 113.57.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 20, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 Providence Mortgage has engaged in, is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that it is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00 et seq.; and  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to Providence Mortgage.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 20, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of Providence Mortgage's original mortgage broker license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license(s). Further, the facts and conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 20 present sufficient grounds for the revocation of Providence Mortgage's mortgage broker license(s) pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.07(2)(b). 	 ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that Providence Mortgage and any and all officers, members, managers, employees, independent contractors, or agents, operating on behalf of Providence Mortgage, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of: (a) mortgage broker, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, and (b) a mortgage loan originator, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 1, on behalf of Providence Mortgage relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Temporary Order.

The latter list should include telephone numbers of contact persons familiar with Providence Mortgage 's submitted loans.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Providence Mortgage shall immediately secure all pending mortgage loan application files and, to the extent that any original documents must be forwarded to the relevant mortgage lender or mortgage broker pursuant to this Temporary Order, a copy of such document, correspondence, or paper relating to the mortgage loan shall be retained in Providence Mortgage's books and records and shall be available to the Commissioner, in their entirety, immediately upon request on the date and time specified by the Commissioner.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Providence Mortgage shall submit financial statements for the preceding fiscal year in the form required by the license renewal provisions of 209 CMR 42.00  et seq .  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Providence Mortgage shall submit a completed Mortgage Broker 2009 Annual Report, in the form provided on the Division's website, and thereupon submit a payment to the Division of the amount then outstanding due to the late filing of the Mortgage Broker 2009 Annual Report. 	 The amount of the late fee shall be determined in accordance with General Laws chapter 255E, section 8 by applying a rate of $50.00 per calendar day for each day after March 31, 2010 on which the Report remained outstanding. The Licensee may contact the Division to clarify or confirm the calculation of the late fee amount; and  Providence Mortgage shall remit payment in accordance with this Paragraph of the Temporary Order for the amount then due, payable to the ""Commonwealth of Massachusetts,"" to the Office of the Commissioner of Banks, Attn: Mortgage Licensing, 1000 Washington St., Floor 10, Boston, MA 02118.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Providence Mortgage shall submit the corporate annual report(s) to the Secretary of the Commonwealth as required pursuant to applicable laws and regulations.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Temporary Order shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless vacated, modified, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 30A. 	 It is understood that the Licensee may petition the Commissioner to vacate or modify this Temporary Order upon presenting to the Division satisfactory evidence that the Licensee has fully complied with the provisions of this Temporary Order.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such Temporary Order shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from Providence Mortgage within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this Temporary Order. If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this Temporary Order shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.

FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  The Division, through the Commissioner, also has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons engaged in the business of a mortgage loan originator in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 2.  NAMOREX is, and at all relevant times has been, a Massachusetts licensed mortgage lender and mortgage broker doing business in the Commonwealth. 	 A. Failure to Submit Financial Statements as Required  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.03(2)(b)3 states: 	 Renewal Applications. Within 90 days of the close of its fiscal year, an Applicant for license renewal shall submit financial statements for the preceding fiscal year that have been  audited by an independent certified public accountant  and such other financial information as the Commissioner may require. [Emphasis supplied.]  On or about October 22, 2009, the Division sent detailed instructions to all licensed mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders regarding the 2010 license renewal application process.  The license renewal instructions notified each recipient that by December 31, 2009, all mortgage lender and mortgage broker licensees were required to remain in compliance with 209 CMR 42.03 and 209 CMR 42.06, respectively, including the requirement to submit to the Division audited or reviewed financial statements, as determined by the type of license(s) held, within ninety (90) days of the end of a licensee's fiscal year end.  On or about March 16, 2010, the Division sent a reminder notice to all licensed mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders regarding the 2010 license renewal requirements. Pursuant to the instructions contained therein, all licensed mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders with a fiscal year end date of December 31  st  were directed to file through the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System (NMLS) the required financial statements by no later than March 31, 2010.  As of the date of this Temporary Order, the Licensee has failed to provide the required financial statements to fulfill the Division's license renewal requirements. 	 B. Failure to File the Massachusetts Corporation (or Foreign Corporation) Annual Report (or LLC Annual Report)  Massachusetts General Laws, chapter 156C, section 12 states, in part, that: 	 a) In order to form a limited liability company, one or more authorized persons must execute a certificate of organization. The certificate of organization shall be filed in the office of the state secretary and set forth:  (1) the name of the limited liability company;  (2) the address of the office in the commonwealth required to be maintained by section five;  (3) the name and address of the resident agent for service of process required to be maintained by section 5; provided, however, that the agent's written consent to the appointment shall be either in the certificate or attached to it;  (4) if the limited liability company is to have a specific date of dissolution, the latest date on which the limited liability company is to dissolve;  (5) if the limited liability company has managers at the time of its formation, the name and address of each manager;  (6) the name of any other person in addition to any manager who is authorized to execute any documents to be filed with the office of the state secretary and at least one such person shall be named if there are no managers;  (7) the general character of the limited liability company's business;  (8) if desired, the names of one or more persons authorized to execute, acknowledge, deliver and record any recordable instrument purporting to affect an interest in real property, whether to be recorded with a registry of deeds or a district office of the land court; and  (9) any other matters the authorized persons determine to be included therein.....  (c) All limited liability companies formed under this chapter shall also file an annual report with the state secretary setting forth the information required in subsection (a).  The license renewal instructions issued by the Division on October 22, 2009 and March 16, 2010 as described above, also notified all licensed mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders of the requirement that all licensees were required to submit to the Secretary of the Commonwealth the applicable Massachusetts Corporation (or Foreign Corporation) Annual Report (or LLC Annual Report) (collectively, the ""Corporate Annual Report"") within two and one half months of the end of Agency Lending's fiscal year end.  As of the date of this Temporary Order, the Licensee has failed to file a 2009 Corporate Annual Report.  On December 30, 2009, NAMOREX, through a duly appointed and authorized representative, affirmed a series of attestations in completing the Company's Massachusetts license renewal application through the NMLS (the ""Renewal Attestation""). The Renewal Attestation provided that the licensee acknowledged and agreed to expediently update and correct the information in the licensee's NMLS record as it changed. NAMOREX further attested, in part, to an understanding that, ""submitting false or misleading information, or omitting pertinent or material information, may be grounds for administrative action and/or criminal action.""  NAMOREX's Renewal Attestation further provided, in part, the following:  The Licensee/Registrant remains in good standing with each jurisdiction's Secretary of State office, or other applicable agency, for each jurisdiction being requested to renew its license/registration;  The Licensee/Registrant meets the financial responsibility requirements and/or net worth requirements, as required by each jurisdiction being requested to renew its license/registration; and  The licensee acknowledged an understanding, and agreed to comply with, the laws and regulations pertaining to the conduct of the licensed business.  On or about May 13, 2010, the Division issued a Final Notice to NAMOREX, providing notification of the deficiencies with NAMOREX's license renewal status and directing NAMOREX to comply with the license renewal process by supplying the outstanding renewal requirements identified in paragraph(s) 4 through 13. The directive required the Company to respond with all applicable information by no later than May 24, 2010. As of the date of this Temporary Order, NAMOREX has failed to submit all, or part of, the required documentation to the Division.  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 14, by failing to file the financial statements that are required pursuant to the license renewal process, NAMOREX has violated 209 CMR 42.03(2)(b)3.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 14, by failing to file its 2009 Corporate Annual Report, NAMOREX has violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 156C, section 12 and the standards of the license renewal process.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 14, the Commissioner has determined that:  NAMOREX has engaged in, is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that it is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00 et seq.; and  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to NAMOREX.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 14, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of NAMOREX'S original mortgage lender and mortgage broker license applications, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license(s). Further, the facts and conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 14 present sufficient grounds for the revocation of NAMOREX'S mortgage lender and mortgage broker license(s) pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.04(2)(b) and 42.07(2)(b).  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that NAMOREX and any and all officers, members, managers, employees, independent contractors, or agents, operating on behalf of NAMOREX, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of: (a) a mortgage lender and/or mortgage broker, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, and (b) a mortgage loan originator, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 1, on behalf of NAMOREX relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Temporary Order. Therefore, NAMOREX is ordered immediately to cease soliciting or accepting, either directly or indirectly, any residential mortgage loan applications from consumers for residential property located in Massachusetts.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that NAMOREX, shall immediately place any fees previously collected from Massachusetts consumers relative to any pending mortgage loan applications in a separate escrow account maintained at a federally insured bank.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that NAMOREX shall immediately place with one or more qualified broker(s) or lender(s), as appropriate based on the status of the application and with no loss to applicants, all of its pending Massachusetts residential mortgage loan applications. It being understood that ""no loss to the applicant"" shall mean that any pending application that has been approved by the Licensee but has not yet closed, shall be placed to a lender willing to fund, or close, the mortgage loan under the same terms and conditions extended by NAMOREX. In the event that no such placement can be made, NAMOREX shall either independently fund the mortgage loan under such terms and conditions or buy down the mortgage loan offered by the lender so that the applicant does not incur a loss as a result of such placement. NAMOREX shall place such applications with a licensed Massachusetts lender(s) or broker(s), as appropriate, or with a financial institution(s) that is exempt from the mortgage licensing requirements under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that as soon as possible, but in no event later than two days after the effective date of this Temporary Order, NAMOREX shall submit the following information in writing to the Commissioner:  A detailed record of all pending residential mortgage loan applications, which shall include, but is not limited to, the following: customer name, address, telephone number; all prepaid loan fees submitted by the customer; amount of loan; application status (i.e. filed, submitted to lenders); scheduled closing date; rate lock status; the location of all original open application files; and a list of applicable wholesale lenders. The latter list should include telephone numbers of contact persons familiar with NAMOREX's submitted loans.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that NAMOREX shall immediately secure all pending mortgage loan application files and, to the extent that any original documents must be forwarded to the relevant mortgage lender or mortgage broker pursuant to this Temporary Order, a copy of such document, correspondence, or paper relating to the mortgage loan shall be retained in NAMOREX's books and records and shall be available to the Commissioner, in their entirety, immediately upon request on the date and time specified by the Commissioner.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that NAMOREX shall submit financial statements for the preceding fiscal year in the form required by the license renewal provisions of 209 CMR 42.00  et seq .  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that NAMOREX shall submit the corporate annual report(s) to the Secretary of the Commonwealth as required pursuant to applicable laws and regulations.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Temporary Order shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless vacated, modified, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 30A.  It is understood that the Licensee may petition the Commissioner to vacate or modify this Temporary Order upon presenting to the Division satisfactory evidence that the Licensee has fully complied with the provisions of this Temporary Order.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such Temporary Order shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from NAMOREX within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this Temporary Order. If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this Temporary Order shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE BROKER  LICENSING  Docket No. 2010-222  FINDINGS OF FACT AND  TEMPORARY ORDER TO  CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  FIRST FIDELITY MORTGAGE COMPANY, INC.  Marlborough, Massachusetts  Mortgage Broker License No(s). MB0310  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that FIRST FIDELITY MORTGAGE COMPANY, INC. (""FIRST FIDELITY"" or the ""Licensee""), with its main address located at 20 East Main Street, Marlborough, Massachusetts, 01752, has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""Temporary Order"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b) and chapter 255F, section 11(a).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  The Division, through the Commissioner, also has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons engaged in the business of a mortgage loan originator in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 2.  FIRST FIDELITY is, and at all relevant times has been, a Massachusetts licensed mortgage broker doing business in the Commonwealth. 	 A. Failure to Submit Annual Report  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8 states, in part: 	 Each licensee shall annually, on or before a date determined by the commissioner, file a report with the commissioner containing such information as said commissioner may require concerning the business and operations conducted by the licensee in the commonwealth during the preceding calendar year.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.10 states: 	 By March 31, each Licensee shall file an annual report with the Commissioner in such form as the Commissioner shall prescribe for the preceding calendar year. The annual report shall be in writing, subscribed by the Licensee under the pains and penalty of perjury.  The 2010 license renewal instructions issued by the Division on October 22, 2009, and the subsequent reminder notice on March 16, 2010, notified all licensed mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders of the requirement that all licensees were required to submit to the Division a completed Mortgage Lender/Mortgage Broker Annual Report for the period ending December 31, 2009 (""Mortgage Lender/Mortgage Broker 2009 Annual Report"") by March 31, 2010. In both sets of instructions, licensees were notified that a $50.00 per calendar day late fee would be assessed to all licensees that failed to submit the Mortgage Lender/Mortgage Broker 2009 Annual Report by March 31, 2010.  As of the date of this Temporary Order, the Licensee has failed to file a Mortgage Lender/Mortgage Broker 2009 Annual Report.  On December 31, 2009, FIRST FIDELITY, through a duly appointed and authorized representative, affirmed a series of attestations in completing the Company's Massachusetts license renewal application through the NMLS (the ""Renewal Attestation""). The Renewal Attestation provided that the licensee acknowledged and agreed to expediently update and correct the information in the licensee's NMLS record as it changed.  FIRST FIDELITY's Renewal Attestation further provided that the licensee acknowledged an understanding, and agreed to comply with, the laws and regulations pertaining to the conduct of the licensed business.  On or about May 13, 2010, the Division issued a Final Notice to FIRST FIDELITY, providing notification of the deficiencies with FIRST FIDELITY's license renewal status and directing FIRST FIDELITY to comply with the license renewal process by supplying the outstanding renewal requirements identified in paragraph(s) 4 through 9. The directive required the Company to respond with all applicable information by no later than May 24, 2010. As of the date of this Temporary Order, FIRST FIDELITY has failed to submit all, or part of, the required documentation to the Division. 	 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 10, by failing to file its Mortgage Lender/Mortgage Broker 2009 Annual Report, FIRST FIDELITY has violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8 and 209 CMR 42.10.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 10, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 FIRST FIDELITY has engaged in, is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that it is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00 et seq.; and  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to FIRST FIDELITY.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 10, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of FIRST FIDELITY'S original mortgage broker license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license(S). Further, the facts and conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 10 present sufficient grounds for the revocation of FIRST FIDELITY'S mortgage broker license(s) pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.04(2)(b) AND/OR, 42.07(2)(b). 	 ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that FIRST FIDELITY and any and all officers, members, managers, employees, independent contractors, or agents, operating on behalf of FIRST FIDELITY, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of: (a) mortgage broker, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, and (b) a mortgage loan originator, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 1, on behalf of FIRST FIDELITY relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Temporary Order. Therefore, FIRST FIDELITY is ordered immediately to cease soliciting or accepting, either directly or indirectly, any residential mortgage loan applications from consumers for residential property located in Massachusetts.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that FIRST FIDELITY, shall immediately place any fees previously collected from Massachusetts consumers relative to any pending mortgage loan applications in a separate escrow account maintained at a federally insured bank.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that FIRST FIDELITY shall immediately place with one or more qualified broker(s) or lender(s), as appropriate based on the status of the application and with no loss to applicants, all of its pending Massachusetts residential mortgage loan applications. FIRST FIDELITY shall place such applications with a licensed Massachusetts broker(s) or lender(s), as appropriate, or with a financial institution(s) that is exempt from the mortgage licensing requirements under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that as soon as possible, but in no event later than two days after the effective date of this Temporary Order, FIRST FIDELITY shall submit the following information in writing to the Commissioner: 	 A detailed record of all pending residential mortgage loan applications, which shall include, but is not limited to, the following: customer name, address, telephone number; all prepaid loan fees submitted by the customer; amount of loan; application status (i.e. filed, submitted to lenders); scheduled closing date; rate lock status; the location of all original open application files; and a list of applicable wholesale lenders. The latter list should include telephone numbers of contact persons familiar with FIRST FIDELITY's submitted loans.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that FIRST FIDELITY shall immediately secure all pending mortgage loan application files and, to the extent that any original documents must be forwarded to the relevant mortgage lender or mortgage broker pursuant to this Temporary Order, a copy of such document, correspondence, or paper relating to the mortgage loan shall be retained in FIRST FIDELITY's books and records and shall be available to the Commissioner, in their entirety, immediately upon request on the date and time specified by the Commissioner.

MB4336  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that ATLANTIS MORTGAGE CORPORATION (""Atlantis Mortgage"" or the ""Licensee""), with its main address located at 13 Hamilton Street, 3  rd  Floor New Bedford, Massachusetts 02740 has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following FINDINGS OF FACT AND TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (""Temporary Order"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b) and chapter 255F, section 11(a).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  The Division, through the Commissioner, also has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons engaged in the business of a mortgage loan originator in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 2.  Atlantis Mortgage is, and at all relevant times has been, a Massachusetts licensed mortgage broker doing business in the Commonwealth.  A. Failure to Submit Financial Statements as Required  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.06(2)(b)3 states:  Renewal Applications. Within 90 days of the close of its fiscal year, an Applicant for mortgage broker license renewal shall submit financial statements for the preceding fiscal year that have been  audited or reviewed  by an independent certified public accountant and such other financial information as the Commissioner may require. [Emphasis supplied.]  On or about October 22, 2009, the Division sent detailed instructions to all licensed mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders regarding the 2010 license renewal application process.  The license renewal instructions notified each recipient that by December 31, 2009, all mortgage lender and mortgage broker licensees were required to remain in compliance with 209 CMR 42.03 and 209 CMR 42.06, respectively, including the requirement to submit to the Division audited or reviewed financial statements, as determined by the type of license(s) held, within ninety (90) days of the end of a licensee's fiscal year end.  On or about March 16, 2010, the Division sent a reminder notice to all licensed mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders regarding the 2010 license renewal requirements. Pursuant to the instructions contained therein, all licensed mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders with a fiscal year end date of December 31  st  were directed to file through the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System (NMLS) the required financial statements by no later than March 31, 2010.  On April 1, 2009, Atlantis Mortgage uploaded financial statements through the NMLS that had been prepared on a compilation basis. These financial statements were not in accordance with the 2010 license renewal instructions or the Division's regulation as they were neither audited nor reviewed by an independent certified public accountant, as required.  As of the date of this Temporary Order, the Licensee has failed to provide the required financial statements to fulfill the Division's license renewal requirements.  B. Failure to Submit Annual Report  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8 states, in part:  Each licensee shall annually, on or before a date determined by the commissioner, file a report with the commissioner containing such information as said commissioner may require concerning the business and operations conducted by the licensee in the commonwealth during the preceding calendar year.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.10 states:  By March 31, each Licensee shall file an annual report with the Commissioner in such form as the Commissioner shall prescribe for the preceding calendar year. The annual report shall be in writing, subscribed by the Licensee under the pains and penalty of perjury.  The license renewal instructions issued by the Division on October 22, 2009 and subsequent reminder notice on March 16, 2010 as described above, also notified all licensed mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders of the requirement that all licensees were required to submit to the Division a completed Mortgage Lender/Mortgage Broker Annual Report for the period ending December 31, 2009 (""Mortgage Lender/Mortgage Broker 2009 Annual Report"") by March 31, 2010. In both sets of instructions, licensees were notified that a $50.00 per calendar day late fee would be assessed to all licensees that failed to submit the Mortgage Lender/Mortgage Broker 2009 Annual Report by March 31, 2010.  As of the date of this Temporary Order, the Licensee has failed to file a Mortgage Lender/Mortgage Broker 2009 Annual Report.  C. Failure to File the Massachusetts Corporation Annual Report  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 156D, section 16.22 states, in part:  (a) Each domestic corporation, and each foreign corporation authorized to transact business in the commonwealth, shall deliver to the secretary of state for filing an annual report that sets forth:  (1) the name of the corporation and the state or country under whose law it is incorporated;  (2) the address of its registered office and the name of its registered agent at that office in the commonwealth;  (3) the address of its principal office;  (4) the names and business addresses of its directors, officers required by section 8.40(a), and chief executive officer and chief financial officer, if different;  (5) A brief description of its activities in the commonwealth.  (6) the total number of authorized shares, itemized by class and series, if any, within each class;  (7) the total number of issued and outstanding shares, itemized by class and series, if any, within each class; and  (8) the fiscal year of the corporation.  (b) Information in the annual report shall be current as of the date the annual report is executed on behalf of the corporation.  (c) The annual report shall be delivered to the secretary of state within 2 1/2 months after the end of the fiscal year of the corporation.  The Secretary of the Commonwealth's regulation 950 CMR 113.57(1) states:  (1) Each domestic corporation and each foreign corporation authorized to transact business in the commonwealth shall file an annual report with the Division within 2½ months after the close of the corporation's fiscal year end.  The license renewal instructions issued by the Division on October 22, 2009 and March 16, 2010 as described above, also notified all licensed mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders of the requirement that all licensees were required to submit to the Secretary of the Commonwealth the applicable Massachusetts Corporation (or Foreign Corporation) Annual Report (or LLC Annual Report) (collectively, the ""Corporate Annual Report"") within two and one half months of the end of Atlantis Mortgage's fiscal year end.  As of the date of this Temporary Order, the Licensee has failed to file a 2009 Corporate Annual Report.  On December 22, 2010, Atlantis Mortgage, through a duly appointed and authorized representative, affirmed a series of attestations in completing Atlantis Mortgage's Massachusetts license renewal application through the NMLS (the ""Renewal Attestation""). The Renewal Attestation provided that the licensee acknowledged and agreed to expediently update and correct the information in the licensee's NMLS record as it changed. Atlantis Mortgage further attested, in part, to an understanding that, ""submitting false or misleading information, or omitting pertinent or material information, may be grounds for administrative action and/or criminal action.""  Atlantis Mortgage's Renewal Attestation further provided, in part, the following:  The Licensee remains in good standing with each jurisdiction's Secretary of State office, or other applicable agency, for each jurisdiction being requested to renew its license;  The Licensee meets the financial responsibility requirements and/or net worth requirements, as required by each jurisdiction being requested to renew its license; and  The licensee acknowledged an understanding, and agreed to comply with, the laws and regulations pertaining to the conduct of the licensed business.  On or about May 13, 2010, the Division issued a Final Notice to Atlantis Mortgage, providing notification of the deficiencies with Atlantis Mortgage's license renewal status and directing Atlantis Mortgage to comply with the license renewal process by supplying the outstanding renewal requirements identified in paragraph(s) 4 through 19. The directive required Atlantis Mortgage to respond with all applicable information by no later than May 24, 2010. As of the date of this Temporary Order, Atlantis Mortgage has failed to submit all, or part of, the required documentation to the Division.  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 20, by failing to file the financial statements that are required pursuant to the license renewal process, Atlantis Mortgage has violated 209 CMR 42.06(2)(b)3  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 20, by failing to file its Mortgage Lender/Mortgage Broker 2009 Annual Report, Atlantis Mortgage has violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8 and 209 CMR 42.10.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 20, by failing to file its 2009 Corporate Annual Report, Atlantis Mortgage has violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 156D, section 16.22 and 950 CMR 113.57.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 20, the Commissioner has determined that:  Atlantis Mortgage has engaged in, is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that it is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00 et seq.; and  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to Atlantis Mortgage.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 20, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of Atlantis Mortgage's original mortgage broker license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license(s). Further, the facts and conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 20 present sufficient grounds for the revocation of Atlantis Mortgage's mortgage broker license(s) pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.07(2)(b).  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that Atlantis Mortgage and any and all officers, members, managers, employees, independent contractors, or agents, operating on behalf of Atlantis Mortgage, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of: (a) mortgage broker, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, and (b) a mortgage loan originator, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 1, on behalf of Atlantis Mortgage relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Temporary Order.

The Licensee may contact the Division to clarify or confirm the calculation of the late fee amount; and  Atlantis Mortgage shall remit payment in accordance with this Paragraph of the Temporary Order for the amount then due, payable to the ""Commonwealth of Massachusetts,"" to the Office of the Commissioner of Banks, Attn: Mortgage Licensing, 1000 Washington St., Floor 10, Boston, MA 02118.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Atlantis Mortgage shall submit corporate annual report(s) to the Secretary of the Commonwealth as required pursuant to applicable laws and regulations.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Temporary Order shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless vacated, modified, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 30A.

FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  The Division, through the Commissioner, also has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons engaged in the business of a mortgage loan originator in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 2.  Agency Lending is, and at all relevant times has been, a Massachusetts licensed mortgage broker doing business in the Commonwealth.  A. Failure to Submit Financial Statements as Required  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.06(2)(b)3 states:  3. Renewal Applications. Within 90 days of the close of its fiscal year, an Applicant for mortgage broker license renewal shall submit financial statements for the preceding fiscal year that have been audited or reviewed by an independent certified public accountant and such other financial information as the Commissioner may require. [Emphasis supplied.]  On or about October 22, 2009, the Division sent detailed instructions to all licensed mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders regarding the 2010 license renewal application process.  The license renewal instructions notified each recipient that by December 31, 2009, all mortgage lender and mortgage broker licensees were required to remain in compliance with 209 CMR 42.03 and 209 CMR 42.06, respectively, including the requirement to submit to the Division audited or reviewed financial statements, as determined by the type of license(s) held, within ninety (90) days of the end of a licensee's fiscal year end.

Pursuant to the instructions contained therein, all licensed mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders with a fiscal year end date of December 31  st  were directed to file through the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System (NMLS) the required financial statements by no later than March 31, 2010.  On March 31, 2010, Agency Lending uploaded financial statements through the NMLS that had been prepared on a compilation basis. These financial statements were not in accordance with the 2010 license renewal instructions or the Division's regulation, as they were neither audited nor reviewed by an independent certified public accountant, as required.  As of the date of this Temporary Order, the Licensee has failed to provide the required financial statements to fulfill the Division's license renewal requirements.  B. Failure to Submit Annual Report  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8 states, in part:  Each licensee shall annually, on or before a date determined by the commissioner, file a report with the commissioner containing such information as said commissioner may require concerning the business and operations conducted by the licensee in the commonwealth during the preceding calendar year.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.10 states:  By March 31, each Licensee shall file an annual report with the Commissioner in such form as the Commissioner shall prescribe for the preceding calendar year. The annual report shall be in writing, subscribed by the Licensee under the pains and penalty of perjury.  The license renewal instructions issued by the Division on October 22, 2009 and subsequent reminder notice on March 16, 2010 as described above, also notified all licensed mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders of the requirement that all licensees were required to submit to the Division a completed Mortgage Lender/Mortgage Broker Annual Report for the period ending December 31, 2009 (""Mortgage Lender/Mortgage Broker 2009 Annual Report"") by March 31, 2010. In both sets of instructions, licensees were notified that a $50.00 per calendar day late fee would be assessed to all licensees that failed to submit the Mortgage Lender/Mortgage Broker 2009 Annual Report by March 31, 2010.  On May 18, 2010, the Division received Agency Lending's Mortgage Lender/Mortgage Broker 2009 Annual Report, which resulted in late annual report filing fee. As of the date of this Temporary Order, the late fee is still outstanding.  C. Failure to File the Massachusetts Corporation (or Foreign Corporation) Annual Report (or LLC Annual Report)  Massachusetts General Laws, chapter 156C, section 12 states, in part, that:  a) In order to form a limited liability company, one or more authorized persons must execute a certificate of organization.

On November 11, 2009, Agency Lending, through a duly appointed and authorized representative, affirmed a series of attestations in completing the Company's Massachusetts license renewal application through the NMLS (the ""Renewal Attestation""). The Renewal Attestation provided that the licensee acknowledged and agreed to expediently update and correct the information in the licensee's NMLS record as it changed. Agency Lending further attested, in part, to an understanding that, ""submitting false or misleading information, or omitting pertinent or material information, may be grounds for administrative action and/or criminal action.""

On or about May 13, 2010, the Division issued a Final Notice to Agency Lending, providing notification of the deficiencies with Agency Lending's license renewal status and directing Agency Lending to comply with the license renewal process by supplying the outstanding renewal requirements identified in paragraph(s) 4 through 19. The directive required the Company to respond with all applicable information by no later than May 24, 2010. As of the date of this Temporary Order, Agency Lending has failed to submit all, or part of, the required documentation to the Division.  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 19, by failing to file the financial statements in the form required by regulation and as indicated during the license renewal process, Agency Lending has violated 209 CMR 42.06(2)(b)3.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 19, by failing to file its Mortgage Lender/Mortgage Broker 2009 Annual Report in a timely manner, Agency Lending has violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8 and 209 CMR 42.10.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 15, by failing to file its 2009 Corporate Annual Report, Agency Lending has violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 156C, section 12 and the standards of the license renewal process.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 15, the Commissioner has determined that:  Agency Lending has engaged in, is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that it is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00 et seq.; and  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to Agency Lending.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 15, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of Agency Lending's original mortgage broker license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license(s). Further, the facts and conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 15 present sufficient grounds for the revocation of Agency Lending's mortgage broker license(s) pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 and the Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.07(2)(b).  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that Agency Lending and any and all officers, members, managers, employees, independent contractors, or agents, operating on behalf of Agency Lending, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of: (a) mortgage broker, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, and (b) a mortgage loan originator, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 1, on behalf of Agency Lending relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Temporary Order.

FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of those engaged in the business of a mortgage broker pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2 and Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8; and of those engaged in the business of a mortgage loan originator pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F.  Mortgage America is, and at all relevant times, has been a company conducting business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Mortgage America's main office at 1 Hunting Lane, Lynnfield, Massachusetts.  Mortgage America was licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage broker license, license number MB4907 to Mortgage America to engage in the business of a mortgage broker on or about July 27, 2007. License number MB4907 authorized Mortgage America to conduct the mortgage broker business from the Corporation's main office located at 1 Hunting Lane, Lynnfield, Massachusetts.  Lisa Cenca is, and at all relevant times has been, the President and 100% owner of Mortgage America. Anthony Cenca is and at all relevant times has been the manager of Mortgage America.  Lisa Cenca is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage loan originator under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 2. According to the Division's records, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage loan originator license, license number MLO31841, to Lisa Cenca to engage in the business of a mortgage loan originator on or about October 15, 2008.  The Division's records indicate that Anthony Cenca is not licensed as a mortgage loan originator in Massachusetts and is not authorized to conduct business under General Laws chapter 255F.  Mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers in Massachusetts are licensed and regulated under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, which is administered and enforced by the Commissioner. Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division is authorized to inspect the books, accounts, papers, records, and files of mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers transacting business in Massachusetts to determine compliance with the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E or any rule, or regulation issued thereunder, and with any law, rule, or regulation applicable to the conduct of the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker.  On or about April 15, 2010, the Division received an inquiry from a Massachusetts consumer regarding concerns related to unlicensed mortgage loan originator activity at Mortgage America.  On May 5, 2010 pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division commenced an examination/inspection of the books, accounts, papers, records, and files maintained by Mortgage America to evaluate the Corporation's compliance with the laws, regulations, and regulatory bulletins applicable to the conduct of a mortgage broker business in Massachusetts and to investigate the concerns that were raised by the inquiry received by the Division and referenced in Paragraph 8 of this Temporary Order (the ""2010 examination/inspection"").  The Division's Report of Examination/Inspection on Consumer Compliance (the ""Report""), which was issued to Mortgage America on the effective date of this Temporary Order, presented the findings of the 2010 examination/inspection and alleged significant failures to comply with applicable state and federal laws, rules, regulations, and regulatory bulletins governing the conduct of those engaged in the business of a mortgage broker in Massachusetts. 	 A. Conducting Residential Mortgage Loan Business in Massachusetts with Unlicensed Mortgage Loan Originators  Effective July 31, 2009, Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 2(a), states, in part:  1 No individual shall act as a mortgage loan originator with respect to any dwelling unless such person has first obtained a mortgage loan originator license from the commissioner or is exempt from the licensure requirement . . . No person shall knowingly employ or retain a mortgage loan originator unless the mortgage loan originator is licensed under this chapter or is exempt from the licensure requirement.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F section 11(e) states: 	 The commissioner may suspend, revoke or refuse to renew the license of the entity employing any licensed mortgage originator upon finding that: (i) the entity knew or reasonably should have known that the mortgage loan originator violated this chapter or any rule or regulation promulgated hereunder, or any other law applicable to the conduct of its business; (ii) the entity knew of any fact or condition which, if it had existed at the time of the original application for such license, would have warranted the commissioner in refusing to issue such license; or (iii) the mortgage loan originator committed any fraud, misappropriated funds or misrepresented any of the material particulars of a mortgage loan transaction approved by the entity.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(17) states: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker or a mortgage lender to conduct business with an individual who should be licensed as a mortgage loan originator under M.G.L. c. 255F, and who the mortgage broker or mortgage lender knows or should know is an unlicensed mortgage loan originator.  On or about April 15, 2010, the Division received an inquiry from a Massachusetts consumer regarding the licensing status of Anthony Cenca and his authorization to conduct business as a mortgage loan originator in the Commonwealth. In response to the inquiry, the Division notified the Massachusetts consumer that Anthony Cenca was not licensed as a mortgage loan originator in the Commonwealth and therefore was not authorized to engage in mortgage loan originator activity in the Commonwealth.  The Massachusetts consumer subsequently forwarded certain information to the Division that indicated that Anthony Cenca was engaging in unlicensed mortgage loan originator activity. The Division's review of the information, specifically e-mail correspondence (""Correspondence"") between the consumer and Anthony Cenca, indicated that Anthony Cenca was utilizing Lisa Cenca's license number to originate mortgage loans in the Commonwealth. A review of the Correspondence revealed that upon an inquiry by the consumer of the license status of Anthony Cenca, Mr. Cenca responded by stating that Lisa Cenca was his wife and when loan originator licensing requirements became effective, both Anthony Cenca and his wife, Lisa thought it would be financially conducive to share one loan originator license between the two parties.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2010 examination/inspection revealed that in at least one loan file reviewed, Anthony Cenca was initially identified as the interviewer on a Uniform Residential Loan Application Form (""1003 Form""). A review of the 1003 Form revealed that Anthony Cenca's name was subsequently removed via ink and Lisa Cenca's name was substituted on the 1003 Form as the interviewer.  In response to the concerns raised in Paragraphs 14 and 15, the Division's Consumer Assistant Unit contacted a sample of consumers to determine the mortgage loan originator with whom the consumer's had interacted with. The Division's discussions with at least two Massachusetts consumers revealed that each applicant identified Anthony Cenca as the individual who had taken the information necessary to complete the 1003 Form and further indicated that Mr. Cenca was the individual with whom the consumers maintained contact with throughout the application process. 1  Effective July 1, 2008 until July 31, 2009, M.G.L. chapter 255F, section 2 stated: ""No person shall act as a mortgage loan originator unless such person has first obtained a mortgage loan originator license from the commissioner. An entity shall not knowingly employ or retain a mortgage loan originator unless the mortgage loan originator is licensed under this chapter."" 	 B. Unfair or Deceptive Acts and Practices  	Alteration and/or Manipulation of Mortgage Loan Related Documents  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) states: 	 Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1) states, in part: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to make any representation or statement of fact if the representation or statement is false or misleading or has the tendency or capacity to be misleading.  The 2010 examination/inspection revealed that Mortgage America manipulated mortgage loan related documents by using ""correction fluid"" to alter information related to the loan process. Specifically, a review of the Appraisal Notification and Acknowledgement Disclosure (""Appraisal Disclosure"") provided to consumers during the loan application process revealed that Mortgage America altered the Appraisal Disclosure after it was provided to consumers.  The Appraisal Disclosure provided to consumers notified mortgage loan applicants of their right to either receive and review a copy of the appraisal report at least three days prior to settlement or in the alternative to waive their right to review the appraisal report three days prior to settlement. The Home Valuation Code of Conduct requires entities to provide consumers with the Appraisal Disclosure.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners revealed that in at least five loan files reviewed, Mortgage America used ""white out"" to alter the form after the applicant had signed the Appraisal Disclosure as fully described in the Report. 	 C. Failure to Properly Maintain Books and Records  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.09(1) states: 	 Each Licensee shall keep and use its books, records and accounts in a manner which will allow the Commissioner to determine whether the Licensee is complying with the provisions of M.G.L. c.255E and applicable state and federal laws and regulations. Each Licensee shall comply with the provisions of 209 CMR 48.00... (b) The mortgage broker ... shall retain for a minimum of three years after a mortgage loan is made the following: the original loan origination and compensation agreement as set out in 209 CMR 42.16; a copy of the settlement statement; an account of fees received in connection with the loan; correspondence; papers or records relating to the loan; and such other documents as the Commissioner may require.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners revealed that Mortgage America failed to retain complete loan files for loan files that were requested by the Division's examiners.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2010 examination/inspection indicated that Mortgage America failed to retain sufficient documentation to enable the Division's examiners to determine whether the Corporation was complying with the provisions of M.G.L. chapter 255E and applicable state and federal laws and regulations. Specifically, the Corporation engaged in a pattern or practice of failing to retain copies of credit reports, appraisals, underwriting conditions, employment verification documentation, 1003 Forms, closing documents, and/or required disclosure forms, as further described in the Report. 	 D. Misrepresentation of Certain Information Reported to the Division  M.G.L. chapter 255E, section 8 states, in part: 	 Each licensee shall annually, on or before a date determined by the commissioner, file a report with the commissioner containing such information as said commissioner may require concerning the business and operations conducted by the licensee in the commonwealth during the preceding calendar year. A licensee neglecting to file such report or failing to amend the same within fifteen days of notice from said commissioner directing the same shall, unless such neglect or failure is due to justifiable cause and not due to wilful [sic] neglect, pay to the commonwealth fifty dollars for each day during which such neglect or failure continues.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.10 states: 	 By March 31, each Licensee shall file an annual report with the Commissioner in such form as the Commissioner shall prescribe for the preceding calendar year. The annual report shall be in writing, subscribed by the Licensee under the pains and penalty of perjury.  On or about February 5, 2010, Mortgage America submitted the Corporation's annual report to the Division. The annual report indicated that the Corporation had originated fifteen (15) mortgage loans from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2009. During the 2010 examination/inspection, Mortgage America provided the Division's examiners with a closed loan list that indicated that the Corporation had originated twenty-four (24) mortgage loans during the same period. 	 E. Undisclosed Fees  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 183, section 63 states, in part: 	 A mortgagee, or a mortgage lender or mortgage broker as defined in section one of chapter two hundred and fifty-five E, shall not charge a loan fee, finder's fee, points, so-called, or similar fees in a mortgage transaction involving residential property located in the commonwealth of four or less units and occupied in whole or in part by the mortgagor, except to the extent that such fees or points have been previously disclosed to the mortgagor in writing, which disclosure may be in the form required by section seventeen D of chapter one hundred and eighty-four, or such other form which discloses said fees or points. A mortgagor shall not be obligated to pay fees or points which have not been previously disclosed as required herein.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2010 examination/inspection indicate that in at least one loan file reviewed, Mortgage America collected broker fees at the loan closing in amounts which the Corporation's books and records failed to document had been fully and accurately disclosed to a consumer, in writing, in the amounts charged at closing, if at all, as more fully described in the Report. 	 F. Engaging in Prohibited Advertising Practices  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.15 states, in part: 	 A Licensee shall also disclose the type and number of its license(s) in all advertisements.  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.04(2) states, in part: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to advertise without clearly and conspicuously disclosing its business name, the words ""broker"" or ""lender"", as applicable, and the license number.  Mortgage America did not disclose the Corporation's license type and number in on its website, www.mortgageamerica.org as required pursuant to 940 CMR 8.04(2).  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(4) states: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker to advertise any interest rate or loan term described in 209 CMR 32.24(3)(a) in any media without the following statement: ""We arrange but do not make loans"". No advertisement by a mortgage broker in any media shall contain language which indicates or suggests that the mortgage broker will fund or approve a mortgage loan or guarantee any rate.  Mortgage America's website advertised interest rates and/or loan terms without including the statement, ""We arrange but do not make loans"" as required pursuant to 209 CMR 42.12A(4). 	 G. Other Violations  In addition to the violations specifically set forth in this Temporary Order, a Report of Examination/Inspection prepared as of May 5, 2010 and to be provided to Mortgage America in conjunction with the issuance of this Temporary Order, describes other violations observed during the 2010 examination/inspection. 	 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 36, Mortgage America has failed to demonstrate and maintain the character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness such as to command the confidence of the community and to warrant a determination that it will operate honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest, as a mortgage broker in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 36, Lisa Cenca, President and sole owner of Mortgage America has failed to demonstrate and maintain the character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness such as to command the confidence of the community and to warrant a determination that she will operate honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest, as a mortgage loan originator in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 41.04(2)(d).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 36, by failing to implement, or causing to be implemented, internal controls in her capacity as the sole owner and President of Mortgage America, that would prevent employees under her supervision from engaging in residential mortgage business without a mortgage loan originator license as required under M.G.L. chapter 255F, Mortgage America and Lisa Cenca violated M.G.L, chapter 255F, section 2(a) and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(17).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 36, by modifying and altering loan documents prepared for consumers, Lisa Cenca in her capacity as the sole owner and President of Mortgage America, has engaged in unfair and deceptive business practices in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) and the Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 36, by failing to keep and use its books, records and accounts in a manner which would allow the Commissioner to determine whether the Corporation is complying with the provisions of M.G.L. c. 255E and applicable state and federal laws and regulations, Mortgage America has violated the Division's regulation 209 CMR 209 42.09(1).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 36, by misrepresenting information reflected on the Annual Report submitted to the Division, Mortgage America has violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.10.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 36, by charging loan fees, points, or similar fees in residential mortgage loan transactions in the Commonwealth, without disclosing such fees or points to the mortgagor, in writing, prior to the closing of the loan, Mortgage America has violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 183, section 63.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 36, by failing to disclose and/or inaccurately disclosing the Corporation's license type and number on its website, Mortgage America has violated the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.15 and the Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.04(2).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 36, by advertising interest rates and/or loan terms on the Corporation's website without including the statement, ""We arrange but do not make loans,"" Mortgage America has violated the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(4).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 36, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 Mortgage America has engaged in, is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that it is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage broker including, but not limited to, the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 7 and the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq.;  Lisa Cenca, has engaged in, is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that she is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a mortgage loan originator including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 41.00  et seq .; and  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to Mortgage America and Lisa Cenca.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 36, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of Mortgage America's original mortgage broker license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 36 present sufficient grounds for the revocation of Mortgage America's mortgage broker licenses pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 and the Division's regulations at, 42.07(2)(b), and 42.12A(20).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 36, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of Lisa Cenca's original mortgage loan originator license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 36 present sufficient grounds for the revocation of Lisa Cenca's mortgage loan originator license pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 41.05. 	 ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that Mortgage America and any and all officers, members, managers, employees, independent contractors, or agents, operating on behalf of Mortgage America, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of: (a) a mortgage broker, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, and (b) a mortgage loan originator, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts, not otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Temporary Order.

254,6/29/2021,2010,Settlement Agreement,"Mortgage Master, Inc.",Mortgage Company,Failed to meet licensing requirements,???,https://www.mass.gov/settlement/mortgage-master-inc," COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  Suffolk, SS.  COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE LENDER AND  MORTGAGE BROKER  LICENSING  Docket No. 2010-044  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  In the Matter of  MORTGAGE MASTER, INC.  Walpole, Massachusetts  Mortgage Company License Nos. MC0226  et al .  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  THIS SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT is made this 29th day of June, 2010 between MORTGAGE MASTER, INC., Walpole, Massachusetts (""Mortgage Master"" or ""Corporation""), a licensed mortgage lender and mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2, and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Division of Banks (""Division"").  BACKGROUND  WHEREAS, an examination/inspection of Mortgage Master was conducted pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, as of February 9, 2009, to assess the Corporation's level of compliance with applicable Massachusetts and federal statutes and the Division's regulations governing the conduct of those engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in the Commonwealth.  WHEREAS, the Report of Examination/Inspection (""Report"") issued pursuant to the Division's examination/inspection of Mortgage Master as of February 9, 2009 alleged substantial non-compliance with applicable state and federal statutes, rules, and regulations governing the conduct of those engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts.  WHEREAS, Mortgage Master cooperated fully with the Division in voluntarily producing information and responding to questions relevant to the examination/inspection, and submitting a detailed response to the Report, attending a conference with the Division, and conferring with the Division on several dates.  WHEREAS Mortgage Master had commenced, if not completed, corrective action on several of the alleged violation areas noted in the Report and this Settlement Agreement prior to, or during, the Examination/Inspection.  WHEREAS, the findings of the Report allege that Mortgage Master allowed individuals to conduct the mortgage business on its behalf who were either not licensed as a mortgage loan originator in accordance with Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F or were not properly sponsored by Mortgage Master in accordance with 209 CMR 41.00  et seq ., and whereas, without any requirement or obligation to do so, Mortgage Master has agreed to satisfy any administrative penalties assessed against some, but not all, of the identified individuals (those so selected by Mortgage Master herein referred to as the ""MLO Class Members"" and identified in Addendum 1 to this Settlement Agreement).  WHEREAS, prior to the Division's examination, Mortgage Master had already taken affirmative steps to identify and address certain findings presented in the Report, including the alleged licensing error(s) that occurred, and continues to move forward with review and enhancements to its internal control environment.  WHEREAS, there is no evidence that the alleged licensing error(s) resulted in any consumer harm and/or impact and the MLO Class Members all were ultimately licensed or licensable.  WHEREAS, Mortgage Master has been advised of its right to Notice and Hearing pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(a), and having waived those rights and without admitting any allegations or implications of fact or the existence of any violation of state or federal laws and regulations governing the conduct and operation of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker.  WHEREAS, to avoid unnecessary time and expense for all concerned, Mortgage Master desires to resolve the concerns of the Division through this Settlement Agreement; and Mortgage Master is entering into this Settlement Agreement with the Division on the terms stated herein.  AGREEMENT  NOW COME the parties in the above-captioned matter, the Division and Mortgage Master, both of whom desire to resolve this matter and agree as follows:  Mortgage Master has established, implemented, enhanced and will continue to maintain procedures to ensure that Mortgage Master does not engage directly or indirectly in the business of a mortgage lender and/or mortgage broker for residential property located in Massachusetts from any location, whether within or without the Commonwealth, for which the Corporation has not previously obtained a license from the Commissioner for such location in accordance with Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. 	 Mortgage Master agrees to submit a payment of sixty thousand dollars ($60,000.00) in satisfaction of an administrative penalty collected in consideration of the Division's findings alleging that the Corporation engaged in mortgage lender and/or mortgage broker activity at unlicensed locations.

The Division shall remit the payment for deposit into the General Fund of the Commonwealth.  Mortgage Master has established, implemented, enhanced and will continue to maintain procedures to ensure that Mortgage Master does not conduct business with any individuals who engage in loan originator activity regarding residential property located in Massachusetts who are not duly licensed and actively sponsored as mortgage loan originators under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F and 209 CMR 41.00  et seq . 	 Mortgage Master agrees to submit a payment totaling four hundred ninety-five thousand dollars ($495,000.00) in satisfaction of an administrative penalty collected in consideration of the Division's findings alleging that the Corporation conducted mortgage business in Massachusetts with and through unlicensed and/or non-sponsored mortgage loan originators. The sum of the administrative penalty representing the combination of a two hundred thousand dollar ($200,000.00) penalty assessed against Mortgage Master and a penalty, in aggregate, of two hundred and ninety-five thousand dollars ($295,000.00) assessed against the MLO Class Members which Mortgage Master agrees to satisfy on behalf of the MLO Class Members.

Mortgage Master has established, implemented, enhanced and will continue to maintain procedures to ensure that Mortgage Master does not make or offer any reverse mortgage loans on residential property in Massachusetts unless the Corporation obtains prior approval of the reverse mortgage program from the Division pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 167E, section 7. 	 Mortgage Master has withdrawn its pending application for approval of the Corporation's reverse mortgage program, which was entered in the Division's records as application A08566.

Part 203 (""Regulation C""). Such procedures shall require the Corporation to implement internal controls to ensure that, for all HMDA reportable loan applications, Mortgage Master accurately compiles and records all required data in the Corporation's HMDA Loan Application Register (""LAR"").

Within ninety (90) days of the effective date of this Settlement Agreement, Mortgage Master shall prepare and submit to the Division a written report detailing the HMDA data that was re-filed by the Corporation pursuant to Paragraph 4(a) of this Settlement Agreement.  Mortgage Master agrees to submit a payment of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) in satisfaction of an administrative penalty collected in consideration of the Division's findings alleging that the Corporation failed to comply with the statutes, rules and regulations governing the conduct of those engaged in the business of a mortgage lender in Massachusetts.

Compliance with this Paragraph of the Settlement Agreement shall require that Mortgage Master review the Division's Regulatory Bulletin 5.1-103: Guidance on Non-Traditional Mortgage Product Risks, the Division's September 2006 Industry Letter, and the Division's Regulatory Bulletin 5.1-104: Statement on Subprime Mortgage Lending, and implement appropriate procedures to ensure compliance therewith.  Mortgage Master shall establish, implement, and maintain policies and procedures to ensure that the Corporation refrains from requiring or permitting consumers to sign blank or partially completed mortgage loan documents. Moreover, Mortgage Master shall ensure that all disclosure documents that require a consumer's acknowledgment of receipt are properly dated to reflect the date the consumer signed or initialed said documents. Mortgage Master will establish and strictly monitor internal controls to identify and prevent any instances in which consumers would be requested to sign blank or partially completed mortgage loan related documents.  Mortgage Master shall establish, implement, and maintain policies and procedures to ensure that any loan fees, application fees, processing fees, discount fees, points, or similar fees collected in a mortgage transaction in Massachusetts are not charged to consumers except to the extent that such fees or points have been properly disclosed to the consumer, in writing, prior to the closing of the mortgage loan. 	 Mortgage Master agrees to reimburse the consumers identified in the Report for the amounts collected as loan fees, application fees, processing fees, discount fees, points, or similar fees at settlement that had not been disclosed to the consumer, in writing, prior to loan closing. The amount of such reimbursement shall equal the difference between the actual charges assessed to the consumer and the amount disclosed in writing for such fee(s) prior to loan closing, as set forth in the Report; and  Within thirty (30) days of the effective date of this Settlement Agreement, Mortgage Master shall submit to the Division sufficient evidence to illustrate the consumers' receipt of the reimbursements issued pursuant to this Paragraph of the Settlement Agreement, including, but not limited to, the consumers' name, the check number(s), the amount of the reimbursement(s), and certified mail receipt(s) to illustrate the consumers' receipt of the reimbursement.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  RETAIL INSTALLMENT SALES  FINANCE COMPANY  LICENSING  Docket No. 2010-238  ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE  AND NOTICE OF INTENT  TO REVOKE RETAIL  INSTALLMENT SALES  FINANCE COMPANY  LICENSE  In the Matter of  FAIR FINANCE COMPANY  Akron, Ohio  Retail Installment Finance Company License No. RI0504  ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLAINT  The Commonwealth of Massachusetts Division of Banks (the ""Division""), by and through the Commissioner of Banks of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the ""Commissioner""), for its Order to Show Cause and Notice of Right to a Hearing (""Order and Notice""), alleges as follows:  The Division brings this action under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255D, sections 7 and 8 to revoke Fair Finance Company's (""Fair Finance"" or the ""Corporation"") retail installment sales finance company license RI0504 due to Fair Finance's failure to comply with the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255D and failure to maintain and demonstrate the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity and general fitness to command the confidence of the public and to warrant the belief that the retail installment sales finance business will be operated lawfully, honestly and fairly, in violation of Massachusetts General Laws, chapter 255D, section 2 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 20.03. 	 JURISDICTION AND VENUE  The Division is an agency of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts with jurisdiction over matters relating to the licensing and regulation of those engaged in the business of a retail installment sales finance company pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255D, section 2.  At all relevant times, Fair Finance has been engaged in the business of a retail installment sales finance company in Massachusetts. 	 RESPONDENT  At all relevant times, Fair Finance has been a foreign corporation conducting business in the Commonwealth with its main office located at 815 East Market Street, Akron Ohio.  Fair Finance is licensed by the Commissioner as a retail installment sales finance company under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255D section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a retail installment finance company license; license number RI0504 on or about November 29, 2002. 	 REGULATORY BACKGROUND  On February 8, 2010, an involuntary bankruptcy petition under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code was filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Ohio against Fair Finance (Case No. 10-5049).  On February 16, 2010, Fair Finance and the petitioning creditors filed joint stipulations of fact with the Bankruptcy Court for the purposes of the petitioning creditors' pending motion seeking appointment of an interim trustee. According to the stipulations, Fair Finance suspended it regular business operations in November 2009 due to the seizure of computers and records by the FBI.  On February 24, 2010, Fair Finance consented to the entry of an order for relief in the chapter 7 bankruptcy case.  M.G.L. chapter 255D, section 3 requires that all retail installment sales finance companies file an annual report with the commissioner on or before April 15 of each year. Fair Finance failed to file its annual report for 2009.  On or about June 16, 2010, the Division attempted to contact Fair Finance by telephone regarding the Corporation's failure to file its annual report. The Division was unable to contact Fair Finance because the Corporation's telephone number of record was no longer in service.  On or about June 16, 2010, following the failed attempts to contact Fair Finance regarding its annual report, the Division investigated the matter further and, in so doing, became aware of the bankruptcy petition referenced in Paragraph 6.  Massachusetts General Law chapter 255D, section 7 states, in part: 	 A [retail installment sales finance company] license may be suspended or revoked by the commissioner on the following grounds: ... (2) failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter; ... (5) the existence of any fact or condition which, if it had existed at the time of the original application for such license, clearly would have warranted the commissioner in refusing to issue such license.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255D, section 2 states, in part: 	 The Commissioner may reject any application for a license or any application for the renewal of a license if he is not satisfied that the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity and general fitness of the applicant... are such as to command the confidence of the public and to warrant the belief that the business for which the application for a license is filed will be operated lawfully, honestly and fairly.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 20.04(2) states, in part: 	 (2) The commissioner may deny such an application [for a retail installment sales finance company] if the Applicant has:  (a) violated any provisions of M.G.L. ... c. 255D or 209 CMR 20.00;  (c) conducted, or will conduct, its business in any unsafe and unsound manner;  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 20.06(1) states, in part: 	 A Licensee shall be required to notify the Division within one business day of the occurrence of any of the following significant developments  a) Licensee filing for bankruptcy or reorganization.  To date, Fair Finance failed to inform the Division about the bankruptcy petition filed against the Corporation or of any of the other events referenced in Paragraphs 6 through 8.  Based upon information and belief, Fair Finance is in liquidation and is no longer operational. 	 VIOLATIONS  The Division hereby re-alleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 17 of this Order and Notice as though fully set forth.  CHARGE ONE:  Fair Finance has failed to demonstrate the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness such as to command the confidence of the public and to warrant a determination that it will operate honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255D, section 2 and 209 CMR 20.03.  CHARGE TWO:  Fair Finance has conducted its business in an unsafe and unsound manner and, had such facts and conditions existed at the time of the Corporation's original application for a retail installment sales finance company, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license, pursuant to 209 CMR 20.04(2).  CHARGE THREE:  By failing to notify the Division of the involuntary bankruptcy petition filed against Fair Finance, the Corporation, is in violation of 209 CMR 20.06 (1) (a).  CHARGE FOUR : The facts and conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 17 present sufficient grounds for the revocation or suspension of Fair Finance's retail installment finance company license pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255D, sections 7 and 8. 	 PRAYER FOR RELIEF  WHEREFORE, the Division, by and through the Commissioner  ,  prays for a final decision as follows: 	 For a final Agency decision awarding temporary and preliminary injunctive relief, and any other ancillary relief, as may be necessary to protect public interest during pendency of this matter.  For a final Agency decision in favor of the Division and against Fair Finance for each Charge set forth in this Order and Notice.  For a final Agency decision revoking Fair Finance's retail installment sales finance company license RI0504, to conduct business as a retail installment sales finance company in Massachusetts.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE LENDER AND  MORTGAGE BROKER  LICENSING  Docket No. 2010-249  FINDINGS OF FACT AND  TEMPORARY ORDER TO  CEASE AND DESIST  AND  NOTICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE  PENALTY  In the Matter of  VILLAGE CAPITAL AND INVESTMENT, LLC  D/B/A VILLAGE HOME MORTGAGE  Mortgage Company License No(s): MC4562 and MC5375  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that VILLAGE CAPITAL AND INVESTMENT, LLC D/B/A VILLAGE HOME MORTGAGE., (""Village Home Mortgage"" or the ""Company""), located at 700 East Gate Drive, Suite 400, Mount Laurel, New Jersey, has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00 et seq., hereby issues the following TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST AND NOTICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTY (""Order"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b) and General Laws chapter 255E, section 11.  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  Village Home Mortgage is, and at all relevant times, has been a foreign corporation conducting business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Village Home Mortgage's main office is located at 700 East Gate Drive, Suite 400, Mount Laurel, New Jersey.  Village Home Mortgage is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage lender and mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner issued a mortgage company license, license number MC4562 to Village Home Mortgage to engage in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker on or about October 27, 2006. License number MC4562 authorized Village Home Mortgage to conduct the mortgage company business from the Company's main office located at 700 East Gate Drive, Suite 400, Mount Laurel, New Jersey.  Village Home Mortgage maintains an additional office location from which the Company conducts its mortgage lender and mortgage broker business. According to records maintained on file with the Division, Village Home Mortgage currently possesses an additional mortgage company license, License number MC5375 which authorizes Village Home Mortgage to conduct the mortgage company business from a location operated at 271 Waverly Oaks Road, Suite 100, Waltham, Massachusetts.  On or about May 28, 2010, the Division was forwarded a copy of a solicitation (""Solicitation"") received by a Massachusetts consumer from Village Home Mortgage. A copy of the solicitation is attached as  Exhibit 1   .  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) states: 	 Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.04(1) states, in part: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to make any representation or statement of fact in an advertisement if the representation or statement is false or misleading or has the tendency or capacity to be misleading.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(9) states: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker or mortgage lender to make false promises to influence, persuade or induce a consumer to sign a mortgage loan application or mortgage loan documents.  The envelope that the Solicitation was mailed in, was designed to give the impression that it had been mailed by a Government Agency and was marked as ""U.S. Government Homeowner Relief Program.""  The Solicitation appeared to be a check in the amount of two hundred eighty thousand ($280,000) dollars payable to the Massachusetts consumer. The check contained an ""Approval ID"" number that stated ""  This U.S. Government Relief Program enables you to refinance up to 97.75% of your home's value. "" The Solicitation notified the consumer that due to the passage of recent legislation passed by the U.S. Government, the Consumer could be eligible to refinance their mortgage loan with ""NO OUT OF POCKET COSTS,"" and further indicated that the new mortgage would be a ""U.S. Government backed loan.""  The Solicitation also notified the consumer that as of March 4, 2009, ""The Making Homes Affordable"" program was released by the Treasury Department and furthermore the program specifically assisted consumers who were unable to lower their monthly payments, however, the language in the Solicitation did not indicate if the particular program that was being marketed to consumers, was directly related to ""The Making Home Affordable Program,"" or if the Solicitation was marketing other program types that may have been available.  The body of the Solicitation identified a table that was labeled as ""Homeowner Relief,"" and identified two types of mortgage loans that the consumer could qualify for, a 30 year fixed program with a rate of 4.75% and a 15 year fixed program for 4.5%. Additionally, the Solicitation advised consumers that the approval would expire on July 1, 2010 and advised consumer to contact a loan specialist with the Approval ID number.  The Solicitation contained no language that indicated that the offer was not being offered by a government agency.  Based on the Division's records, Village Home Mortgage is not a government agency. 	 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 14, Village Home Mortgage has failed to demonstrate and maintain the character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the mortgage lender and mortgage broker business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulations 209 CMR 42.03(2)(c) and 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 14, by mailing Massachusetts consumers a Solicitation containing false or misleading language or language that had the tendency to be false or misleading, including language that could lead the reader to believe that the Solicitation was issued by a government agency, Village Home Mortgage has violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a), and the Office of the Attorney General's implementing regulation 940 CMR 8.04(1).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 14, by mailing Massachusetts consumers a Solicitation that appeared to make false promises to influence, persuade or induce a consumer to sign a mortgage loan application including indications that the mortgage loan would have ""NO OUT OF POCKET COSTS"" with no additional information including but not limited to factors such as the cost of third party fees such as Appraisals and settlement services fees and further references about programs offered through the ""The Making Home Affordable Program,"" that the borrower may not have qualified for, Village Home Mortgage violated the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(9).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 14, the Commissioner has determined that:  Village Home Mortgage has engaged in, is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that the public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to Village Home Mortgage.  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST AND NOTICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTY  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that Village Home Mortgage shall cease mailing any Solicitations to Massachusetts consumers that contain any representations or statements that could be considered false, misleading, or have the tendency or capacity to be misleading including but not limited to:  Solicitations that contain language that could lead the reader to believe that the Solicitation is being issued by a government agency; and  Solicitations that have the tendency to make false promises to influence, persuade or induce a consumer to sign a mortgage loan application.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that within five (5) days of the effective date of this Order, Village Home Mortgage shall submit to the Commissioner a detailed record, prepared as of the date of submission, of all Massachusetts consumers to whom the Company distributed the Solicitation. The records to be produced shall include the consumers' names and addresses.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this Order, Village Home Mortgage shall submit a payment of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) in satisfaction of an administrative penalty collected in consideration of the Corporation's engaging in deceptive advertising. Such administrative penalty is imposed pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 11. The Corporation shall remit payment pursuant to this Paragraph of the Order for the amount due, payable to the ""Commonwealth of Massachusetts,"" to the Office of the Commissioner of Banks, 1000 Washington Street, 10th Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02118-6400. The Division shall remit the payment for deposit into the General Fund of the Commonwealth. The administrative penalty imposed on Village Home Mortgage as referenced in this Order is subject to review as provided in Massachusetts General Laws chapter 30A. Accordingly, Village Home Mortgage may request a hearing to contest said administrative penalty. Such request for a hearing must be filed in writing within 20 days of Village Home Mortgage's receipt of this Order. If the Corporation fails to request a hearing within the prescribed time frame pursuant to this Paragraph, the aforementioned administrative penalty shall be deemed final and binding and shall be due and owing to the Commonwealth.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such Order shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from Village Home Mortgage within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this Order. If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this Order shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Order shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 30A.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Village Home Mortgage shall review and revise, as necessary, the Corporation's policies and procedures to ensure that individuals performing on behalf of the Corporation neither act, nor represent themselves, as a government entity; and  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a copy of each advertisement used by Village Home Mortgage shall be retained in the Corporation's books and records and shall be made available to the Division at its examinations/inspections of the Village Home Mortgage. 	 GENERAL PROVISIONS  Village Home Mortgage shall revise its advertising practices and procedures to ensure that all solicitations and advertising materials used by the Corporation do not contain any representations or statements that could be considered false, misleading, or have the tendency or capacity to be misleading.  Village Home Mortgage shall take all necessary steps to ensure that the Solicitation or any similar solicitation is not published or distributed to consumers in Massachusetts.  Village Home Mortgage shall implement, establish and maintain a system of internal controls to monitor the Corporation's compliance with the laws and regulations applicable to advertising practices including, but not limited to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 140D, the Division's regulations 209 CMR 32.00 et seq. and 209 CMR 42.12A; and the Office of the Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.00 et seq.  Village Home Mortgage shall establish, implement and maintain policies and procedures to ensure that all advertisements are thoroughly reviewed by senior management prior to publication or distribution to consumers. Such procedures shall include a review of the criteria utilized to generate mailing lists to ensure that targeted solicitations are appropriate for the consumers to whom such solicitations are distributed.

According to records maintained on file with the Division, NFM currently possesses two (2) additional mortgage company licenses from the Commissioner for locations operated in Marlton, New Jersey and Reisterstown, Maryland.  On or about May 14, 2010, the Division was forwarded a copy of a mortgage loan solicitation (""Solicitation"") received by a Massachusetts consumer from NFM. A copy of the solicitation is attached as  Exhibit 1.    Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) states: 	 Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.04(1) states, in part: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to make any representation or statement of fact in an advertisement if the representation or statement is false or misleading or has the tendency or capacity to be misleading.  The Solicitation, marked as a ""FEDERAL HOUSING,"" notice appeared to have been forwarded from an ""Audit Review"" department with a form number and includes several references which collectively create an appearance that the Solicitation was issued by a government agency. Specifically, the Solicitation contains a seal that resembles the Seal of the United States Federal Government. The Seal contained language that indicated that the Solicitation was an ""Official Notice"" and from the ""Interest Rate Reduction Department."" In addition, the body of the Solicitation referenced a case number that with ""FHA"" referenced.  The body of the Solicitation notified the consumer that records indicated that the consumer ""had yet to file for Federal programs sponsored by Federal Housing"" and furthermore that the consumer was ""entitled to these funds and further assistance."" Additionally, the Solicitation advised consumers to contact an assigned Federal Housing Case Manager immediately as the ""notice [was] crucial to [their] program acceptance.  Language indicating that the offer was not being offered by a government agency was included in the Solicitation, notwithstanding the representations identified above which indicate a government affiliation. However, such language was in a font size that was significantly smaller then that in the body of the Solicitation and was located in a non-prominent location at the bottom of the Solicitation.  Based on the Division's records, NFM is not a government agency.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(9) states: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker or mortgage lender to make false promises to influence, persuade or induce a consumer to sign a mortgage loan application or mortgage loan documents.  The Solicitation included a list of program benefits including: No Closing Costs; Refunds of Mortgage Insurance Premiums; Lower Interest Rates and Payments; No Increase in Loan Balance; No Appraisal-for a limited time; and No Income Verification. However, language at the bottom of the Solicitation indicated that eligibility was subject to income, credit and home value and that language was in a font size that was significantly smaller than that in the body of the Solicitation and was located in a non-prominent location at the bottom of the Solicitation. 	 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 13, NFM has failed to demonstrate and maintain the character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the mortgage lender and mortgage broker business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulations 209 CMR 42.03(2)(c) and 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 13, by mailing Massachusetts consumers a Solicitation containing false or misleading language or language that had the tendency to be false or misleading, including language that could lead the reader to believe that the Solicitation was issued by a government agency, NFM has violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a), and the Office of the Attorney General's implementing regulation 940 CMR 8.04(1).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 13, by mailing Massachusetts consumers a Solicitation that made false promises to influence, persuade or induce a consumer to sign a mortgage loan application including references to benefits of the program that included factors such as no income verification and no appraisals, NFM violated the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(9).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 13, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 NFM has engaged in, is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that the public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to NFM.  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST AND NOTICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTY  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that NFM shall cease mailing any Solicitations to Massachusetts consumers and that contain any representations or statements that could be considered false, misleading, or have the tendency or capacity to be misleading including but not limited to: 	 Solicitations that contain language that could lead the reader to believe that the Solicitation is being issued by a government agency; and  Solicitations that have the tendency to make false promises to influence, persuade or induce a consumer to sign a mortgage loan application including references to benefits of the program that included factors such as no income verification and no appraisals.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that within five (5) days of the effective date of this Order, NFM shall submit to the Commissioner a detailed record, prepared as of the date of submission, of all Massachusetts consumers to whom the Corporation distributed the Solicitation. The records to be produced shall include the consumers' names and addresses  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this Order, NFM shall submit a payment of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) in satisfaction of an administrative penalty collected in consideration of the Corporation's engaging in deceptive advertising. Such administrative penalty is imposed pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 11. The Corporation shall remit payment pursuant to this Paragraph of the Order for the amounts due, payable to the ""Commonwealth of Massachusetts,"" to the Office of the Commissioner of Banks, 1000 Washington Street, 10th Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02118-6400. The Division shall remit the payment for deposit into the General Fund of the Commonwealth. The administrative penalty imposed on NFM as referenced in this Order are subject to review as provided in Massachusetts General Laws chapter 30A. Accordingly, NFM may request a hearing to contest said administrative penalty. Such request for a hearing must be filed in writing within 20 days of NFM's receipt of this Order. If the Corporation fails to request a hearing within the prescribed time frame pursuant to this Paragraph, the aforementioned administrative penalty shall be deemed final and binding and shall be due and owing to the Commonwealth.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such Order shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from NFM within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this Order. If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this Order shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Order shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 30A.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that NFM shall review and revise, as necessary, the Corporation's policies and procedures to ensure that individuals performing on behalf of the Corporation neither act, nor represent themselves, as a government entity; and  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a copy of each advertisement used by NFM shall be retained in the Corporation's books and records and shall be made available to the Division at its examinations/inspections of the NFM. 	 GENERAL PROVISIONS  NFM shall revise its advertising practices and procedures to ensure that all solicitations and advertising materials used by the Corporation do not contain any representations or statements that could be considered false, misleading, or have the tendency or capacity to be misleading.  NFM shall take all necessary steps to ensure that the Solicitation or any similar solicitation is not published or distributed to consumers in Massachusetts.  NFM shall implement, establish and maintain a system of internal controls to monitor the Corporation's compliance with the laws and regulations applicable to advertising practices including, but not limited to the Division's regulations 209 CMR 42.12A and the Office of the Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.00  et seq .  NFM shall establish, implement and maintain policies and procedures to ensure that all advertisements are thoroughly reviewed by senior management prior to publication or distribution to consumers. Such procedures shall include a review of the criteria utilized to generate mailing lists to ensure that targeted solicitations are appropriate for the consumers to whom such solicitations are distributed.

(a) Within sixty (60) days from the effective date of this CONSENT ORDER, the Bank shall formulate a new written plan (Risk Exposure Plan) to reduce the levels of all adversely classified assets and to reduce the Bank's risk exposure in each asset relationship in excess of one million dollars ($1 million) classified as ""Substandard"" in the 2010 Report of Examination. For purposes of this provision, ""reduce"" means to collect, charge off, or improve the quality of an asset so as to warrant its removal from adverse classification by the FDIC or the Division. In developing the plan mandated by this paragraph, the Bank shall, at a minimum, with respect to each adversely classified loan or lease, review, analyze, and document the financial position of the borrower, including source of repayment, repayment ability, and alternative repayment sources, as well as the value and accessibility of any pledged or assigned collateral, and any possible actions to improve the Bank's collateral position.  (b) In addition, the Risk Exposure Plan shall include, but not be limited to, the following:  (i) A schedule for reducing the outstanding dollar amount of each adversely classified asset, including timeframes for achieving the reduced dollar amounts (at a minimum, the schedule for each adversely classified asset must show its expected dollar balance on a quarterly basis);  (ii) Specific action plans intended to reduce the Bank's risk exposure in each classified asset;  (iii) A schedule showing, on a quarterly basis, the expected consolidated balance of all adversely classified assets, and the ratio of the consolidated balance to the Bank's projected Tier 1 capital plus the allowance for loan and lease losses;  (iv) A provision for the Bank's submission of monthly written progress reports to its Board; and  (v) A provision mandating Board review of the progress reports, with a notation of the review recorded in the minutes of the meeting of the Board.  (c) The Bank shall submit the Risk Exposure Plan to the Area Director and the Commissioner for review. Within thirty (30) days from receipt of any comment from the Area Director and the Commissioner, and after incorporation and adoption of any required changes, the Board shall approve the Risk Exposure Plan, which approval shall be recorded in the minutes of the meeting of the Board. Thereafter, the Bank shall implement and fully comply with the Risk Exposure Plan.  6.

335,9/10/2021,2010,"Temporary Cease and Desist,Notice of Administrative Penalty","A-Plus Mortgage, LLC dba APM Mortgage",Mortgage Broker,,,https://www.mass.gov/temporary-order-to-cease-and-desist/a-plus-mortgage-llc-dba-apm-mortgage," COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  Suffolk, SS.  COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE BROKER  LICENSING  Docket No. 2010-325  TEMPORARY  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  AND  NOTICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE  PENALTY  In the Matter of  A-PLUS MORTGAGE, LLC D/B/A APM MORTGAGE  West Warwick, Rhode Island  Mortgage Broker License No. MB4599  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that A-PLUS MORTGAGE, LLC D/B/A APM MORTGAGE (""APM Mortgage"" or the ""Company"") located 35 Quaker Lane, Suite 2, West Warwick, Rhode Island, has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST AND NOTICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTY (""Order"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b) and General Laws chapter 255E, section 11.  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  APM Mortgage is, and at all relevant times, has been a limited liability company conducting business in the Commonwealth. APM Mortgage's main office is located at 35 Quaker Lane, Suite 2, West Warwick, Rhode Island.  APM Mortgage is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner issued a mortgage broker license, license number MB4599 to APM Mortgage to engage in the business of a mortgage broker on or about November 9, 2006. License number MB4599 authorized APM Mortgage to conduct the mortgage broker business from the Company's main office located at 35 Quaker Lane, Suite 2, West Warwick, Rhode Island.  Between July 27, 2010 and August 16, 2010, the Division was forwarded copies of at least four solicitations (""Solicitations"") received by Massachusetts consumers from APM Mortgage. Copies of the Solicitations are attached as Exhibit 1, Exhibit 2, Exhibit 3 and Exhibit 4.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 167, section 37 states in part: 	 A person, domestic or foreign corporation, partnership, association, limited liability company or similar entity shall not make reference to an existing bank, federal bank, federal branch, foreign bank, out-of-state bank, out-of-state branch, out-of-state federal bank as defined in section 1 of this chapter, or federal credit union as defined in section 1 of chapter 171, or any subsidiary thereof, without the express written consent of the bank, federal bank, federal branch, foreign bank, out-of-state bank, out-of-state branch, out-of-state federal bank or federal credit union, or any subsidiary thereof, or make reference to a loan number, loan amount or other specific loan information on the outside of an envelope, visible through the envelope window, or on a postcard in connection with any written solicitation or an email for products or services to a specifically identified consumer.  A person, domestic or foreign corporation, partnership, association, limited liability company, association or similar entity, which is considered to have violated this section, shall be considered to have engaged in an unfair and deceptive practice and shall be a violation of chapter 93A.  The Division's Regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(9) states: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker or mortgage lender to make false promises to influence, persuade, or induce a consumer to a sign a mortgage loan application or mortgage loan documents.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) states: 	 Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.04(1) states: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to make any representation or statement of fact in an advertisement if the representation or statement is false or misleading or has the tendency or capacity to be misleading, or if the mortgage broker or lender does not have sufficient information upon which a reasonable belief in the truth of the representation or statement could be based.  The Solicitations identified the consumer's lender as JP Morgan Chase Bank on Exhibit 1 and 2 and Scituate Federal Savings Bank on Exhibit 3.  On or about August 16, 2010, the Division received a written complaint regarding the advertising activities of APM Mortgage. The correspondence indicated that the Company had not received any authorization to utilize the name of one of the banks identified in Paragraph 9 of this Order.  The Solicitation, referenced in Paragraph 9 of this Order as Exhibit 1 was marked as an  ""URGENT NOTICE!""  and urged the consumer to ""PLEASE CALL IMMEDIATELY."" The body of the Solicitation notified the consumer that they should contact a certain number as it was regarding their mortgage with  ""JP MORGAN CHASE BANK.""  Additionally, the Solicitation notified the consumer that APM Mortgage could ""consolidate their existing mortgage and revolve their debt into one low monthly payment.""  The Solicitation advised the consumer that AMP Mortgage was lending on a ""government program"" for a specified timeframe, however failed to identify what program the Company was referring to. In addition, the Solicitation contained a webpage address noting that it was the consumer's ""personal webpage"" and instructed the consumer to visit the webpage using the customer's e-mail address.  The Solicitation referenced in Paragraph 9 of this Order as Exhibit 2, appeared to have been mailed by JP Morgan Chase Bank as it was marked as ""RE: JP Morgan Chase Bank"" and stated that the consumer's mortgage with JP Mortgage Chase Bank had ""gone under review."" The body of the Solicitation notified the consumer that as their mortgage had gone under review, they would be able to freeze their mortgage into a fixed rate mortgage with ""a lower monthly payment and/or additional cash out."" In addition, the Solicitation also stated that if the consumer restructured their loan within the specified time period, the consumer would be able to ""skip 2 monthly payments,"" a statement that was both inaccurate and misleading. The Solicitation advised the consumer to call APM Mortgage at a specific number to ""begin the restructure process.""  The Solicitation, referenced in Paragraph 9 of this Order as Exhibit 3 appeared to have been mailed by Scituate Federal Savings Bank as it was marked as ""RE: Scituate Federal Savings and Loan Association,"" and stated that the consumer's mortgage with Scituate Federal Savings Bank had ""gone under review."" The body of the Solicitation notified the consumer that as their mortgage had gone under review, they would be able to freeze their mortgage into a fixed rate mortgage with ""a lower monthly payment and/or additional cash out."" In addition, the Solicitation also stated that if the consumer restructured their loan within the specified time period, the consumer would be able to ""skip 2 monthly payments,"" a statement that was both inaccurate and misleading. The Solicitation advised the consumer to call APM Mortgage at a specific number to ""begin the restructure process.""  Both Solicitations identified and attached as Exhibit 2 and Exhibit 3 contained both an Equal Housing Lending Logo and Department of Housing and Urban Development seal. APM Mortgage is licensed as a mortgage broker in the Commonwealth and therefore is not be permitted to distribute advertising materials that contain the Equal Housing Lending Logo.  The Solicitation, identified as Exhibit 4 appeared to have been forwarded by a government agency as it contained a seal that indicated that the document was forwarded from the ""Federal Housing Commission,' and identified the Solicitation as a ""SECOND NOTICE STIMULUS ACT IRC SECTON 6109C."" The body of the Solicitation stated in part ""ECONOMIC STIMULUS ACT-BAILOUT REFERENCE NUMBER."" The Solicitation notified the consumer that as a result of the Economic Stimulus Act the Federal Housing Authority had ""adjusted their lending policies,"" and as a result the Consumer was eligible to apply for lower fixed rates.  Language indicating that the offer was not being offered by a government agency was included in the Solicitation, notwithstanding the representations identified above which indicate a government affiliation. However, such language was in a font size that was significantly smaller than that in the body of the Solicitation and was located in a non-prominent location at the bottom of the Solicitation.  Based on the Division's records, APM Mortgage is not a government agency. 	 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 18, APM Mortgage has failed to demonstrate and maintain the character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the mortgage broker business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 18, by mailing Massachusetts consumers multiple Solicitations that contained a reference to a bank without the bank's express written consent, APM Mortgage has violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 167, section 37 and Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 18, by mailing Massachusetts consumers multiple Solicitations that contained false or misleading language or language that had the tendency to be false or misleading, including language that could lead the reader to believe that the Solicitation was issued by the consumer's mortgage lender, or a government agency, and asserting that the consumer was eligible for a mortgage consolidation through a government program, lower monthly payment, a new fixed mortgage, and that the consumer could skip two monthly payments, which APM Mortgage did not have sufficient information upon which a reasonable belief in the truth of that representation could be based, APM Mortgage has violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a), and the Office of the Attorney General's implementing regulation 940 CMR 8.04(1).

An entity shall not knowingly employ or retain a mortgage loan originator unless the mortgage loan originator is licensed under this chapter."") 	 No individual shall act as a mortgage loan originator with respect to any dwelling unless such person has first obtained a mortgage loan originator license from the commissioner or is exempt from the licensure requirement ... No person shall knowingly employ or retain a mortgage loan originator unless the mortgage loan originator is licensed under this chapter or is exempt from the licensure requirement.  On or about May 12, 2010, the Division reviewed the following websites:  www.houserichandcashpoor.com ,  www.reversemortgageadvisor.com , and  www.reversemortgageadvisor.com  all of which identify Kenneth Terrill as a reverse mortgage consultant.  The websites indicate that Mr. Terrill is currently soliciting and/or accepting mortgage loan applications from Massachusetts consumers through the website.

Each of the webpages contains certain information relative to reverse mortgage loans and further identifies Kenneth Terrill as a reverse mortgage consultant.  The websites referenced in Paragraph 7 also indicate that inquires regarding reverse mortgage loans are ""welcomed from all 50 states.""  The ""How to Apply"" webpage includes information on how applicants would be able to apply for a reverse mortgage loan including options to apply for reverse mortgage loans via telephone and receiving quotes via the webpage.  The website  www.fhareversemortgages.com  contains links to the following six webpages: Home Page; About Us; Requesting Information; Reverse Mortgage Fact; and Common Concerns.

In 1982 the Terrill's formed Terrill Financial, Inc. and became an independent Mortgage Originator. The name was changed to American Mortgage Professionals, Inc. in 1992 to facilitate better placement in the Yellow Pages.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE LENDER  MORTGAGE BROKER AND  MORTGAGE LOAN ORIGINATOR  LICENSING  CEASE DIRECTIVE  In the Matter of  REVERSE MORTGAGE DIRECTORY, LLC  Los Angeles, California  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") is charged with the administration of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq.,  relating to the licensing of mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers; and Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 41.00  et seq.,  relating to the licensing of mortgage loan originators.  Pursuant to the authority granted by Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, the Commissioner has investigated the activities of REVERSE MORTGAGE DIRECTORY, LLC (""Reverse Mortgage Directory"") located at 10100 Santa Monica Blvd. Suite 410, Los Angeles, California, to determine if Reverse Mortgage Directory has engaged in the business of, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E,. Based upon such investigation, the Division hereby issues the following CEASE DIRECTIVE (""Cease Directive"") as a result of the findings alleged herein.  A. FINDINGS OF FACT  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2 relative to the licensing requirements for entities engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and/or mortgage broker states in part: 	 No person shall act as a mortgage broker or mortgage lender with respect to residential property unless first obtaining a license from the commissioner.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1 defines a mortgage broker as: 	 any person who for compensation or gain, or in the expectation of compensation or gain, directly or indirectly negotiates, places, assists in placement, finds or offers to negotiate, place, assist in placement or find mortgage loans on residential property for others.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) states: 	 Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.  On or about May 11, 2010 and June 4, 2010, the Division was forwarded an online advertisement published by Reverse Mortgage Directory and subsequently reviewed a website maintained by Revere Mortgage Directory at  www.reversemortgageadviser.com . The online advertisement is attached as  Exhibit 1   .  The online advertisement contained the following language: ""Stimulus for Seniors"", ""Government Guaranteed"", and ""Get Money Now"" and directed individuals to the website maintained by Reverse Mortgage Directory at  www.reversemortgageadviser.com . The Division's review of the online advertisement revealed that Reverse Mortgage Directory included limited information about reverse mortgage programs and furthermore that the online advertisement referenced inaccurate and or misleading information regarding reverse mortgage loans including but not limited to the statement that reverse mortgage loans were ""Government Backed"" and represented a ""Stimulus for Seniors"" giving the impression that a reverse mortgage loan is somehow available as part of a government sponsored stimulus plan.  The Division's review of the website maintained by Reverse Mortgage Directory found that it directed consumers to complete certain information to ""Get a Free Quote,"" including but not limited to a prospective borrower's name, address, e-mail address, phone number and estimated value of their property. In addition, the website contained an 800 telephone number that consumers could call to get more information.  The Division's records indicate that Reverse Mortgage Directory is not licensed to do business as a mortgage broker in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 167E, section 7 states in part; 	 A bank may make or acquire a reverse mortgage loan, pursuant to a program for reverse mortgage loans which has been submitted to and approved by the commissioner…  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 167E, §7, is made applicable to all mortgagees making reverse mortgage loans in the Commonwealth by General Laws chapter 183, section 67 which requires Massachusetts state-chartered banks and all other mortgagees including federally-chartered banks and credit unions intending to make reverse mortgage loans to submit for the Division's approval a program, which meets specific criteria set forth in General Laws chapter 167E, section 7.  The website contained certain information relative to reverse mortgage products and reverse mortgage lenders. Through the ""Find a Lender"" webpage on the homepage, the consumer is a directed to a list of reverse mortgage lenders in the state of their choice, including Massachusetts.  The ""Find a Lender"" webpage for Massachusetts lenders states in part that the listing of all reverse mortgage lenders are ""properly licensed in Massachusetts"", and describes the lenders as ""qualified Massachusetts Reverse Mortgage Lender[s]"".  The Division's records indicate that several Massachusetts reverse mortgage lenders listed on Reverse Mortgage Directory's website are not licensed or approved to make or acquire reverse mortgage loans in Massachusetts.  As of the date of this Cease Directive, the website maintained by Reverse Mortgage Directory continues to be operational. 	 B. CEASE DIRECTIVE  Reverse Mortgage Directory and any and all officers, members, managers, employees, independent contractors, or agents, operating on behalf of Reverse Mortgage Directory, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging in the activities of a mortgage broker, as those activities are defined under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1, relative to any residential property in Massachusetts. Therefore, Reverse Mortgage Directory is ordered to immediately cease soliciting or accepting, either directly or indirectly, any residential mortgage loan applications from consumers for residential property located in Massachusetts.

338,9/14/2021,2010,Temporary Cease and Desist,"Alpha Money Transfer, Inc.",Foreign Transmittal Agency,,,https://www.mass.gov/temporary-order-to-cease-and-desist/alpha-money-transfer-inc," COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  Suffolk, SS.  COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  FOREIGN TRANSMITTAL  AGENCY LICENSING  No. 2010-326  FINDINGS OF FACT AND  TEMPORARY ORDER TO  CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  ALPHA MONEY TRANSFER, INC.  Nashua, New Hampshire  Foreign Transmittal Agency License No(s): FT5529  et al.  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that ALPHA MONEY TRANSFER, INC., located at 402 Amherst Street, Suite 204, Nashua, New Hampshire (""Alpha Money"" or the ""Corporation"") has engaged, or is engaged in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169, and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 44.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST pursuant to General Laws chapter 169, section 13(b).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons engaged in the business of a foreign transmittal agency pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169.  Alpha Money is, and at all relevant times has been, a foreign corporation conducting business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Alpha Money's main office is located at 402 Amherst Street, Suite 204, Nashua, New Hampshire.  Alpha Money is licensed by the Commissioner as a foreign transmittal agency under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a foreign transmittal license to Alpha Money on or about June 15, 2007, with license number FT5529. License number FT5529 authorized Alpha Money to operate as a foreign transmittal agency at 19 Mill Street, Lowell, Massachusetts.  Alpha Money maintains thirty one (31) additional foreign transmittal licenses for thirty-one authorized agents, for locations operated in the Commonwealth from which the Corporation conducts its foreign transmittal business.  Alpha Money transmits money received from Massachusetts consumers primarily to Brazil. According to information reflected on the Corporation's 2009 annual report filed with the Division, Alpha Money transmitted $24,710, 536.15 for calendar year 2009.  Alpha Money is a money service business as defined by The Bank Secrecy Act (""BSA"") and its implementing regulation at 31 C.F.R. Part 103.  Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169, section 10, the Division conducted an inspection of the books, accounts, papers, records, and files of Alpha Money on June 29, 2010 (the ""2010 examination/inspection"").  The Division's Report of Examination/Inspection on Consumer Compliance (the ""Report""), which was issued to Alpha Money on the effective date of this Temporary Order, presented the findings of the 2010 examination/inspection and alleged significant failures to comply with applicable state and federal laws, rules, regulations, and regulatory guidelines governing the conduct of those engaged in the business of a foreign transmittal agency in Massachusetts as more specifically enumerated in this Temporary Order. 	 A. Failure To Demonstrate the Financial Responsibility, Character, Reputation, Integrity, and General Fitness to Maintain a Foreign Transmittal Agency License  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169, section 12 relevant to the licensing of foreign transmittal agencies states: 	 The commissioner may suspend or revoke any license issued pursuant to this chapter if he finds that: (a) the licensee has violated any provision of this chapter or any rule or regulation adopted hereunder or any other law applicable to the conduct of such business; or (b) any fact or condition exists which, if it had existed at the time of the original application for such license, would have warranted the commissioner to refuse to issue such license.  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 44.04(2) states in part: 	 (a) The Commissioner may deny an application to engage in the business of foreign transmittal agency, if the Commissioner upon review of the application and other relevant information, determines that the Applicant has not satisfied the requirements of M.G.L. c. 169 or 209 CMR 44.03.  (b) The Commissioner may also deny such an application if the Applicant has:  1. violated any provision of M.G.L. c. 169 or 209 CMR 44.00;  	2. violated or engaged in a pattern of violations of any state or federal law applicable to the conduct of the business of a foreign transmittal agency and any rule, regulation or administrative order or directive promulgated thereunder;  	3. conducted, or will conduct, its business in an unsafe and unsound manner...  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2010 examination/inspection revealed that Alpha Money failed to maintain the financial responsibility character, reputation and integrity to conduct the foreign transmittal business in the Commonwealth as the Corporation conducted the foreign transmittal business in an unsafe and unsound manner by conducting business with unauthorized foreign agents and co-mingling the Corporation's escrow and business accounts by utilizing Massachusetts consumer funds to conduct the Corporation's business as specifically enumerated in this Temporary Order. 	 B. Failure to Establish Adequate and Appropriate Polices, Procedures and Controls with Foreign Correspondents  The BSA's implementing regulation at 31 C.F.R. § 103.125 states, in part: 	 (a) Each money services business ... shall develop, implement and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program .... that is reasonably designed to prevent the money services business from being used to facilitate money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities.  (b) The program shall be commensurate with the risks posed by the location and size of, and the nature and volume of the financial services provided by, the money services business.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169, section 8 states, in part: 	 All money received for transmission to a foreign country by any licensee shall be forwarded to the person to whom the same is directed within seven days following receipt thereof...  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 44.10(5) states: 	 Grounds for license revocation under M.G.L. c. 169, § 12 and the issuance of cease and desist orders under M.G.L. c. 169, § 13 shall include, but are not limited to, the following prohibited acts and practices by Licensees:  (5) failing to forward all money received for transmission to a foreign country to the person to whom the same is directed within seven days following receipt thereof.  The BSA's implementing regulation at 31 C.F.R. § 103.125(d) requires all money services businesses including but not limited to a foreign transmittal agency such as Alpha Money to implement written anti-money laundering policies and procedures that, at a minimum: (1) incorporate policies and procedures and internal controls reasonably designed to assure compliance with this part, including requirements verifying customer identification, filing reports, creating and retaining records, and responding to law enforcement requests; (2) designate a person to assure day to day compliance with the program; (3) provide for education and/or training of appropriate personnel, including training in the detection of suspicious transactions; and (4) provide for independent review to monitor and maintain an adequate program.  The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network Interpretative Release, 2004-1 (""2004-1 Interpretative Release""), which Alpha Money is subject to, requires money service business agents utilizing foreign agents to incorporate ""certain risk-based policies, procedures and controls designed to identify and minimize money laundering and terrorist financing risks associated with foreign agents and counterparties that facilitate the flow of funding into and out of the United States.""  The 2004-1 Interpretative Release states in part: 	 A Money [s]ervices [b]usiness' anti-money program should include procedures for the following...(1) Conduct of Due Diligence on Foreign Agents and Counterparties...(2) Risk-based monitoring for Foreign Agents or Counterparties...(3) Corrective Action and Termination.  The Central Bank of Brazil authorizes and supervises the operations of foreign agents conducting business in Brazil. The Division's review of the directory of agents authorized to engage in foreign exchange transactions in Brazil available from the Central Bank of Brazil, indicates that Alpha Money currently maintains an agent relationship with an unauthorized foreign agent in Brazil.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2010 examination/inspection revealed that Alpha Money's failure to establish an effective anti-money laundering program resulted in the Corporation's failure to investigate and verify the license status of Alpha Money's unauthorized foreign agent and establish adequate and appropriate policies procedures and controls commensurate with the risk of money laundering and the financing of terrorism posed by the Corporation's relationship with the unauthorized foreign agent.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2010 examination/inspection further revealed that Alpha Money failed to incorporate any risk based policies, procedures or controls identified in the 2004-1 Interpretive Release and frequently received payment instructions from the unauthorized foreign agent to reconcile funds paid to beneficiaries in Brazil. Instead of remitting the funds to the intended recipient, payment instructions from agents often required Alpha Money to transfer funds to third parties in the United States that had no connection to the customer initiating the transmittal.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiner during the 2010 examination/inspection revealed that Alpha Money failed to retain records evidencing the receipt of funds by consumers in Brazil within seven days. 	 C. Prohibited Use of Consumer Funds/Commingling  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 44.07(4) states: 	 No person licensed as a foreign transmittal agency shall commingle money collected for transmission abroad from clients with its own funds or use any part of a client's money in the conduct of the Licensee's business.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2010 examination/inspection found that Alpha Money maintained at least four accounts at two banking institutions. Three of the four accounts were designated as escrow accounts which contained consumer funds. A review of the transactions and account records for the three escrow accounts revealed that Alpha Money consistently utilized funds deposited in the escrow accounts for various business purposes. The account records reviewed indicated that at least one escrow account was linked to a corporate debit card and the same account was used for various purposes including but not limited to agent deposits, correspondent payments and miscellaneous business expenses, including gas and food purchases. 	 D. Designated Compliance Officer  The BSA's implementing regulation at 31 C.F.R. § 103.125(d)(2) states, in part: 	 [The money services business' anti-money laundering program shall] [d]esignate a person to assure day to day compliance with the program and this part. The responsibilities of such person shall include assuring that: (i) The money services business properly files reports, and creates and retains records, in accordance with applicable requirements of this part; (ii) The compliance program is updated as necessary to reflect current requirements of this part, and related guidance issued by the Department of the Treasury; and (iii) The money services business provides appropriate training and education in accordance with paragraph (d)(3) of this section.  Alpha Money has designated a compliance officer however, the examination/inspection revealed that the compliance officer failed to effectively perform the required duties necessary for that position. Alpha Money's designated compliance officer failed to ensure that the Corporation was in compliance with the Division's regulations and BSA requirements by: failing to ensure that the Corporation maintained records demonstrating that consumer funds transmitted to Brazil were received within seven days; failing to ensure that the Corporation had implemented risk-based policies, procedures and controls with foreign agents by maintaining a business relationship with an unauthorized foreign agent; and failing to ensure that staff were appropriately educated and trained to ensure that escrow funds were properly utilized. 	 E. Failure to Comply with Written Policies and Procedures  The BSA's implementing regulation at 31 C.F.R. § 103.125(d)(4) states: 	 [The money services business' anti-money laundering program shall] [p]rovide for independent review to monitor and maintain an adequate program. The scope and frequency of the review shall be commensurate with the risk of the financial services provided by the money services business. Such review may be conducted by an officer or employee of the money services business so long as the reviewer is not the person designated in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.  Books and records reviewed by the Division's examiners during the 2010 examination/inspection indicate that Alpha Money's anti-money laundering program manual requires the Corporation to ensure that an independent review is conducted at least annually. Records reviewed by the Division's examiners revealed that Alpha Money failed to ensure that an independent review had been conducted for the calender year 2009. 	 F. Engaging in Prohibited Advertising Practices  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 44.10(3) states, in part: 	 Grounds for license revocation under M.G.L. c. 169, § 12 and the issuance of cease and desist orders under M.G.L. c. 169, § 13 shall include, but are not limited to, the following prohibited acts and practices by Licensees:  (3) failing to disclose the type and number of its license(s) to all clients in writing at the time deposits for transmittal abroad are accepted or to fail to disclose the type and number of its license(s) in all advertisements.  Alpha Money failed to disclose the Corporation's license type and number on the Corporation's advertisements. 	 G. Other Violations  In addition to the violations specifically set forth in this Temporary Order, a Report of Examination/Inspection on Consumer Compliance prepared as of June 29, 2010 and to be provided to Alpha Money in conjunction with the issuance of this Temporary Order, describes other violations observed during the 2010 examination/inspection. 	 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based on the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 30, Alpha Money has failed to demonstrate the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the business will operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169, section 6 the Division's regulation 209 CMR 44.03, and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 44.04.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 though 30, Alpha Money failed to implement an effective anti-money laundering program commensurate with the risks posed by the location and size of, and nature and volume of the financial services provided by the Corporation, in violation of 31 C.F.R. § 103.125.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 30, Alpha Money failed to establish risk-based policies, procedures and controls designed to identify and minimize money laundering and terrorist financing risks associated with conducting business with a foreign entity in violation of 31 C.F.R. § 103.125 and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network Interpretative Release, 2004-1.  Based on the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 30, Alpha Money, failed to retain any records to ensure that funds received for transmissions to Brazil were remitted within seven days of receipt thereof in violation of M.G.L. chapter 169 section 8 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 44.10(5).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 though 30, by utilizing consumer funds in the conduct of the Corporation's business Alpha Money is in violation of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 44.07(4).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 though 30, Alpha Money's designated compliance officer failed to effectively perform the duties required to ensure compliance with The Bank Secrecy Act's requirements, in violation of 31 C.F.R. § 103.125(d)(2).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 30, by failing to conduct an independent review that was commensurate with the risk of the services provided by the Corporation, and failing to comply with the Corporation's own written policies and procedures, Alpha Money is in violation of The Bank Secrecy Act's requirements, in violation of 31 C.F.R. § 103.125(d)(4).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 30, by failing to disclose the Corporation's license type and number on the Corporation's advertisements, Alpha Money is in violation of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 44.10(3).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 30, the public interest will be harmed by delay in issuing an Order to Cease and Desist under General Laws chapter 169, section 13(b) because, upon information and belief, Alpha Money has collected funds from Massachusetts consumers that it is utilizing for both business expenses and for transmittal to an unauthorized foreign agent in Brazil. As of the date of this Temporary Order, Alpha Money has failed to demonstrate that those funds received for transmissions from Massachusetts consumers were remitted within seven days of receipt.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 30, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 Alpha Money has engaged, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that the Corporation is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a foreign transmittal agency including, but not limited to, the provisions under General Laws chapter 169 and the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 44.00  et seq .  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to Alpha Money.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 30, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of Alpha Money's original foreign transmittal agency license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. 	 ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that Alpha Money, any and all officers, directors, employees, independent contractors, or agents operating on behalf of Alpha Money, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging directly or indirectly in the business of a foreign transmittal agency in Massachusetts, as defined in M.G.L. chapter 169, section 1, except as otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Temporary Order or by the Commissioner.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that within (1) day of the effective date of this Temporary Order, Alpha Money shall submit to the Commissioner: a detailed record of the Corporation's pending transmittal orders for funds received from Massachusetts consumers. The records to be provided shall be as of the effective date of this Temporary Order.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Alpha Money, shall ensure that all consumer funds previously collected from Massachusetts consumers relative to any transactions are placed in a separate escrow account and shall not be utilized for business purposes.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Temporary Order shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless set aside, limited or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review pursuant to General Laws chapter 30A.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such Temporary Order shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from the Licensee within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this Temporary Order. If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this Temporary Order shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.     BY ORDER AND DIRECTION OF THE COMMISSIONER OF BANKS.

Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1 defines a mortgage lender as:  any person engaged in the business of making mortgage loans, or issuing commitments for mortgage loans.  	   Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 1 defines a mortgage broker as:  any person who for compensation or gain, or in the expectation of compensation or gain, directly or indirectly negotiates, places, assists in placement, finds or offers to negotiate, place, assist in placement or find mortgage loans on residential property for others.  	   Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255F, section 2 relative to the licensing requirements for a mortgage loan originator states:  No natural person shall act as a mortgage loan originator unless such person has first obtained a mortgage loan originator license from the commissioner. An entity shall not knowingly employ or retain a mortgage loan originator unless the mortgage loan originator is licensed under this chapter.  On or about August 17, 2010 the Division's Consumer Assistance Unit received a complaint filed by a Massachusetts consumer regarding the unlicensed activities of SKG and Greg Gibson in the Commonwealth.  The Division's review of the documents and correspondence between the consumer and Greg Gibson who appeared to be acting as a mortgage loan originator on behalf of SKG included certain documents including but not limited to, a Uniform Residential Loan Application, mortgage loan commitment and a mortgage loan pre-approval letter that appeared to have been prepared on behalf SKG.  The Division's review of the documents indicate that Greg Gibson identified himself as the mortgage loan originator on the Uniform Residential Loan application and furthermore that SKG was identified as the mortgage lender on a mortgage loan commitment, verification of deposit form and verification of employment form.  The Division's records indicate that SKG has never applied to the Division to obtain a license to operate as a mortgage lender or mortgage broker in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  The Division's records indicate that Greg Gibson has never applied to the Division to obtain a license to operate as a mortgage loan originator in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE BROKER  LICENSING  Docket No. 2010-329  TEMPORARY  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  AND  NOTICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE  PENALTY  In the Matter of  Universal Mortgage Group, LLC  Boston, Massachusetts  Mortgage Broker License No. MB3794  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that UNIVERSAL MORTGAGE, LLC (""Universal Mortgage"" or the ""Company"") located at 516 E 2  nd  Street, Suite 3, Boston, Massachusetts, has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST AND NOTICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTY (""Order"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b) and General Laws chapter 255E, section 11.  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  Universal Mortgage is, and at all relevant times, has been a limited liability company conducting business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Universal Mortgage's main office is located at 516 E 2  nd  Street, Suite 3 in Boston, Massachusetts.  Universal Mortgage is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a mortgage broker license number MB3794 to Universal Mortgage to engage in the business of a mortgage broker on or about February 7, 2005. License number MB3794 authorized Universal Mortgage to conduct its mortgage broker business from the Company's main office located at 516 E 2  nd  Street, Suite 3 in Boston, Massachusetts.  Mortgage brokers in Massachusetts are licensed and regulated under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, which is administered and enforced by the Commissioner. Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division is authorized to inspect the books, accounts, papers, records, and files of mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers transacting business in Massachusetts to determine compliance with the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E or any rule, or regulation issued thereunder, and with any law, rule, or regulation applicable to the conduct of the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker.  On July 28, 2010, pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division commenced an examination/inspection of the books, accounts, papers, records, and files maintained by Universal Mortgage to evaluate the Company's compliance with the laws, regulations, and regulatory bulletins applicable to the conduct of a mortgage broker business in Massachusetts (the ""2010 examination/inspection"").  During the 2010 examination/inspection, the Division's examiners requested copies of all advertising related materials that had been sent to Massachusetts consumers. In response to this request, Universal Mortgage provided copies of its advertising materials and solicitations (""Solicitations""). Copies of the Solicitations are attached as Exhibit 1, Exhibit 2, Exhibit 3, and Exhibit 4 and incorporated herein. 	 Misleading and Deceptive Advertising Practices  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) states: 	 Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.04(1) states, in part: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to make any representation or statement of fact if the representation or statement is false or misleading or has the tendency or capacity to be misleading.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(9) states: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker to make false promises to influence, persuade or induce a consumer to sign a mortgage loan application or mortgage loan documents.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(4) states: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker to advertise any interest rate or loan term described in 209 CMR 32.24(3)(a) in any media without the following statement: ""We arrange but do not make loans"". No advertisement by a mortgage broker in any media shall contain language which indicates or suggests that the mortgage broker will fund or approve a mortgage loan or guarantee any rate.  The Division's review of the Solicitations provided by Universal Mortgage during the 2010 examination/inspection revealed that the Solicitations included several references which were misleading and deceptive, including references that gave the appearance that Universal Mortgage was a licensed as a mortgage lender in the Commonwealth. The Solicitations also included certain references which collectively created an appearance that they were issued by a government agency.  A review of the Solicitations indicate that one solicitation appeared to have been forwarded to consumers that would have qualified for a reverse mortgage and a review of the solicitation indicated that it was sent from Universal Mortgage's ""ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES"", located in Ellicott City, Maryland. The solicitation was identified as a ""Notice of 2009 Funding Increase for Seniors.""  (Exhibit 1)    .  A review of the Division's records indicate that Universal Mortgage does maintain a license for a location in Ellicott City, Maryland.  The solicitation also included a pre-qualification number and the body of this solicitation indicated that the consumer had been ""pre-selected"" to participate in a ""government backed program"", with consumer funds ""available now."" The solicitation identified a specific monthly disbursement amount, as well as a lump sum draw and credit amount that the consumer would be entitled to receive. This solicitation failed to note that the proceeds that were set forth would be affected by an appraisal of the property as well as ancillary costs associated with obtaining a reverse mortgage including closing costs, mortgage insurance premiums and monthly servicing fees. (Exhibit 1).  The solicitation further noted that the consumer would have to contact an ""authorized lender"" by August 31, 2009 in order to receive additional information and identified Universal Mortgage as the authorized lender above the Company's toll free number which was designated as the contact number.  (Exhibit 1)    .  The solicitation indicated that the consumer could receive a monthly disbursement in the amount of $2,193.00 with a loan amount of $385,798.77. The maximum lending limit was identified as $625,000.00. This solicitation did not include the statement, ""We arrange but do not make loans"" as required pursuant to 209 CMR 42.12A(4).  (Exhibit 1)    .  A second solicitation reviewed by the Division contained a header that stated ""Stop Foreclosure *No Mortgage Payments* You Still Own Your Home."" The body of the solicitation gave the appearance that consumers who obtained a reverse mortgage would have no mortgage payments and would own their home without having to make any payments, statements which are both inaccurate and misleading as reverse mortgage borrowers are required to make real estate tax and hazard insurance payments unless such payments are escrowed.  (Exhibit 2)    .  A third solicitation reviewed referenced a Federal Housing Authority program allowing for a ""cash-out up to 95%"" and identified a phone number for a consumer to call by a specific date to get a free consultation. The body of the solicitation indicated that based on information gathered from credit reporting agencies and well as a review of the consumer's financial situation, the consumer had been pre-selected to refinance with a ""FIXED RATE"" mortgage with a rate of 5.5%. The solicitation contained an Equal Housing Lending Logo and specified a new monthly payment of $1,198.00 based upon an estimated loan balance of $210,960.00. This solicitation did not include the statement, ""We arrange but do not make loans"" as required pursuant to 209 CMR 42.12A(4).  (Exhibit 3)    .  At least two Solicitations, contained references that gave the impression that Universal Mortgage was licensed as a mortgage lender by including statements that encouraged consumers to call an ""authorized lender"" incorporated the Equal Housing Lending Logo on the solicitations forwarded to Massachusetts consumers. Universal Mortgage is not licensed by the Commissioner to conduct business as a mortgage lender in Massachusetts pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 2 and the Division's regulation 209 42.00  et seq.   (Exhibit 1, and Exhibit 3)    .  A fourth solicitation reviewed was marked as a ""Form 009 Payment Reduction Notification"" and stated that the identified consumer was pre-qualified for a mortgage loan in the amount of $218,149.00 at a fixed rate of 4.25%, and a monthly payment of about $1,073.00. This solicitation did not include the statement, ""We arrange but do not make loans"" as required pursuant to 209 CMR 42.12A(4).  (Exhibit 4)    .  Two of the four Solicitations stated that if the consumer restructured their loan within the specified time period, the consumer would be able to avoid making mortgage payments for two months, a statement that was both inaccurate and misleading.  (Exhibit 3 and Exhibit 4)    .  Three of the four Solicitations reviewed imposed a time-frame in which the consumer was required to respond to the offer which created the impression that the consumer would be required to take prompt action in order to benefit from the respective ""programs"" offered by each solicitation. (Exhibit 1, Exhibit 3 and Exhibit 4).  Language indicating that the offer was not being offered by a government agency was included in at least one Solicitation reviewed, notwithstanding the representations identified above which indicate a government affiliation. However, such language was in a font size that was significantly smaller than that in the body of these solicitations and was located in a non-prominent location at the bottom of the solicitations.  (Exhibit 1)    .  Based on the Division's records, Universal Mortgage is not affiliated with any government agency. 	 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 24, Universal Mortgage has failed to demonstrate and maintain the character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the mortgage broker business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 24, by mailing Massachusetts consumers multiple Solicitations containing false or misleading language or language that had the tendency to be false or misleading, including language that could lead the reader to believe that the Solicitation was issued by a government agency, Universal Mortgage has violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a), and the Office of the Attorney General's implementing regulation 940 CMR 8.04(1).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 24, by mailing Massachusetts consumers Solicitations containing language that gave the impression that Universal Mortgage was authorized to operate as a licensed mortgage lender in Massachusetts, the Company violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2 and the Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.04(1).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 24, by mailing Massachusetts consumers a Solicitation that made false promises to influence, persuade or induce a consumer to sign a mortgage loan application including references to specific monthly and lump sum payments that do not take into account the appraisal of the property and other ancillary costs associated with obtaining a reverse mortgage loan, and by imposing a time-frame in which consumers were required to respond to the offer, Universal Mortgage violated the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(9)  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 24, by mailing Massachusetts consumers a Solicitation referencing loan terms without including the statement, ""We arrange but do not make loans,"" Universal Mortgage has violated the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(4).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 24, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 Universal Mortgage has engaged in, is engaging in , or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that the public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to Universal Mortgage.  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST AND NOTICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTY  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that Universal Mortgage shall cease mailing the Solicitations identified as Exhibits 1, 2, 3, 4 and any Solicitations to Massachusetts consumers that contain any representations or statements that could be considered false, misleading, or have the tendency or capacity to be misleading including but not limited to:  Solicitations containing false or misleading language or language that had the tendency to be false or misleading, including language that could lead the reader to believe that the Solicitation was issued by a government agency;  Solicitations containing false or misleading language or language that had the tendency to be false or misleading, including language that could lead the reader to believe that the Solicitation was issued by a licensed mortgage lender;  Solicitations that have the tendency to make false promises to influence, persuade or induce a consumer to sign a mortgage loan application including references to the consumer's eligibility for a new fixed rate mortgage, lower monthly payments, and/or eligibility to skip 2 monthly payments.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that within five (5) days of the effective date of this Order, Universal Mortgage shall submit to the Commissioner a detailed record, prepared as of the date of submission, of all Massachusetts consumers to whom the Company distributed the Solicitation. The records to be produced shall include the consumers' names and addresses.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this Order, Universal Mortgage shall submit a payment of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) in satisfaction of an administrative penalty collected in consideration of the Company's engaging in deceptive and prohibited advertising. Such administrative penalty is imposed pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 11. The Company shall remit payment pursuant to this Paragraph of the Order for the amounts due, payable to the ""Commonwealth of Massachusetts,"" to the Office of the Commissioner of Banks, 1000 Washington Street, 10th Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02118-6400. The Division shall remit the payment for deposit into the General Fund of the Commonwealth.  The administrative penalty imposed on Universal Mortgage is subject to review as provided in Massachusetts General Laws chapter 30A. Accordingly, Universal Mortgage may request a hearing to contest said administrative penalty. Such request for a hearing must be filed in writing within 20 days of Universal Mortgage's receipt of this Order. If the Company fails to request a hearing within the prescribed time frame pursuant to this Paragraph, the aforementioned administrative penalty shall be deemed final and binding and shall be due and owing to the Commonwealth.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such Order shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from Universal Mortgage within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this Order. If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this Order shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Order shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 30A.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Universal Mortgage shall review and revise, as necessary, the Company's policies and procedures to ensure that individuals performing on behalf of the Company neither act, nor represent themselves, as a government agency; and  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a copy of each advertisement used by Universal Mortgage shall be retained in the Company's books and records and shall be made available to the Division at its examinations/inspections of Universal Mortgage. 	 GENERAL PROVISIONS  Universal Mortgage shall revise its advertising practices and procedures to ensure that all solicitations and advertising materials used by the Company do not contain any representations or statements that could be considered false, misleading, or have the tendency or capacity to be misleading.  Universal Mortgage shall take all necessary steps to ensure that the Solicitations or any similar solicitation is not published or distributed to consumers in Massachusetts.  Universal Mortgage shall implement, establish and maintain a system of internal controls to monitor the Company's compliance with the laws and regulations applicable to advertising practices including, but not limited to the Division's regulations 209 CMR 42.12A and the Office of the Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.00  et seq .  Universal Mortgage shall establish, implement and maintain policies and procedures to ensure that all advertisements are thoroughly reviewed by senior management prior to publication or distribution to consumers. Such procedures shall include a review of the criteria utilized to generate mailing lists to ensure that targeted solicitations are appropriate for the consumers to whom such solicitations are distributed.     BY ORDER AND DIRECTION OF THE COMMISSIONER OF BANKS.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE LENDER AND  MORTGAGE BROKER  LICENSING  Docket No. 2010-327  TEMPORARY  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  AND  NOTICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE  PENALTY  In the Matter of  SHAMROCK FINANCIAL CORPORATION  Providence, Rhode Island  Mortgage Company License No: MC3303  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that SHAMROCK FINANCIAL CORPORATION, (""Shamrock Financial"" or the ""Corporation"") located at 75 Newman Avenue, East Providence, Rhode Island, has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST AND NOTICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTY (""Order"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b) and General Laws chapter 255E, section 11.  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  Shamrock Financial is, and at all relevant times, has been a foreign corporation conducting business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Shamrock Financial's main office is located at 75 Newman Avenue, East Providence, Rhode Island.  Shamrock Financial is licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage lender and mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued mortgage broker license number MB0153 to Shamrock Financial to engage in the business of a mortgage broker on or about April 28, 1994. The Division's records indicate that Shamrock Financial was subsequently issued a mortgage lender and mortgage broker license number MC3303 which became effective on or about October 2, 2002.  On or about July 15, 2010, the Division was forwarded a copy of a solicitation (""Solicitation"") received by a Massachusetts consumer from Shamrock Financial. A copy of the Solicitation is attached as  Exhibit 1.    Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) states: 	 Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1) states: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to make any representation or statement of fact in an advertisement if the representation or statement is false or misleading or has the tendency or capacity to be misleading, or if the mortgage broker or lender does not have sufficient information upon which a reasonable belief in the truth of the representation or statement could be based.  The Division's Regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(9) states: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker or mortgage lender to make false promises to influence, persuade, or induce a consumer to a sign a mortgage loan application or mortgage loan documents.  The Solicitation, marked ""NOTICE - Essex County Resident"" was forwarded from a ""Lynn Service Center"" and contained the consumer's property information. The body of the Solicitation notified the consumer that ""due to changes in Shamrock Financial's mortgage policy guidelines,"" there was a new program available to the consumer as an Essex County resident. The Solicitation stated that the property information was obtained from public county records, contained a file number, and notified the consumer of their eligibility for a mortgage payment reduction available only to Essex County residents. The bottom of the notice contained a statement that all programs follow Federal Fair Housing regulations, and was accompanied by the corresponding federal ""Equal Housing Lender"" logo.  The body of the Solicitation notified the consumer that Shamrock Financial could not process the consumer's new payment until they called the Corporation. The Solicitation also notified the consumer that they would have to call before a certain date to ""confirm [their] mortgage payment reduction so that [their] lower payment could be processed,"" a statement that could lead the consumer to believe that the Solicitation was being forwarded by their current mortgage holder and they had automatically qualified for a lower monthly mortgage payment.  The language and references in the notice collectively create the appearance that the Solicitation was issued by a government agency. Language indicating that the offer was being made by Shamrock Financial and not a government agency was included in the Solicitation. However, such language was in font size that was significantly smaller than that of the body of the Solicitation and was located in a non prominent location at the bottom of the Solicitation.  The notice instructed the consumer to call a designated telephone number in order to ""confirm"" their mortgage payment reduction, also instructing the consumer to have their ""file number"" ready when they called. Language at the bottom of the notice disclosed that eligibility was subject to underwriting guidelines, that minimum and maximum loan amounts apply, that other restriction may apply, and that as a result of refinancing, total finance charges may be higher over the life of the loan. However, this language was in a font size that was significantly smaller than that in the body of the Solicitation and was located on a non-prominent location at the bottom of the Solicitation.  Based on the Division's records, Shamrock Financial is not a government agency. 	 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 12, Shamrock Financial has failed to demonstrate and maintain the character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the mortgage lender and mortgage broker business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulations 209 CMR 42.03(2)(c) and 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 12, by mailing Massachusetts consumers a Solicitation containing false or misleading language or language that had the tendency to be false or misleading, including language that could lead the reader to believe that the Solicitation was issued by a government agency, and indicating that the consumer was eligible for a mortgage payment reduction, which Shamrock Financial did not have sufficient information upon which a reasonable belief in the truth of that representation could be based, Shamrock Financial has violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a), and the Office of the Attorney General's implementing regulation 940 CMR 8.06(1).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 12, by mailing Massachusetts consumers a Solicitation that made false promises to influence, persuade or induce a consumer to sign a mortgage loan application, including references that the consumer's eligibility for a mortgage payment reduction was available only to residents of their county, which the consumer was informed could be obtained by just calling to confirm, Shamrock Financial violated the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(9).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 12, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 Shamrock Financial has engaged in, is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that the public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to Shamrock Financial.  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST AND NOTICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTY  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that Shamrock Financial shall cease mailing any Solicitations to Massachusetts consumers that contain any representations or statements that could be considered false, misleading, or have the tendency or capacity to be misleading including but not limited to: 	 Solicitations that contain language that could lead the reader to believe that the Solicitation is being issued by a government agency; and  Solicitations that have the tendency to make false promises to influence persuade or induce a consumer to sign a mortgage loan application including references to the consumer's eligibility for a mortgage payment reduction available upon telephone confirmation.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that within five (5) days of the effective date of this Order, Shamrock Financial shall submit to the Commissioner a detailed record, prepared as of the date of submission, of all Massachusetts consumers to whom the Corporation distributed the Solicitation. The records to be produced shall include the consumers' names and addresses.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this Order, Shamrock Financial shall submit a payment of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) in satisfaction of an administrative penalty collected in consideration of the Corporation's engaging in deceptive advertising as evidenced by the Solicitation. Such administrative penalty is imposed pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 11. The Corporation shall remit payment pursuant to this Paragraph of the Order for the amounts due, payable to the ""Commonwealth of Massachusetts,"" to the Office of the Commissioner of Banks, 1000 Washington Street, 10th Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02118-6400. The Division shall remit the payment for deposit into the General Fund of the Commonwealth. The administrative penalty imposed on Shamrock Financial as referenced in this Order is subject to review as provided in Massachusetts General Laws chapter 30A. Accordingly, Shamrock Financial may request a hearing to contest said administrative penalty. Such request for a hearing must be filed in writing within 20 days of Shamrock Financial's receipt of this Order. If the Corporation fails to request a hearing within the prescribed time frame pursuant to this Paragraph, the aforementioned administrative penalty shall be deemed final and binding and shall be due and owing to the Commonwealth.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such Order shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from Shamrock Financial within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this Order. If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this Order shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Order shall become effective immediately and shall remain in effect unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the Commissioner or upon court order after review under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 30A.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Shamrock Financial shall review and revise, as necessary, the Corporation's policies and procedures to ensure that individuals performing on behalf of the Corporation neither act, nor represent themselves, as a government entity; and  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a copy of each advertisement used by Shamrock Financial shall be retained in the Corporation's books and records and shall be made available to the Division at its examinations/inspections of Shamrock Financial. 	 GENERAL PROVISIONS  Shamrock Financial shall revise its advertising practices and procedures to ensure that all solicitations and advertising materials used by the Corporation do not contain any representations or statements that could be considered false, misleading, or have the tendency or capacity to be misleading.  Shamrock Financial shall take all necessary steps to ensure that the Solicitation or any similar solicitation is not published or distributed to consumers in Massachusetts.  Shamrock Financial shall implement, establish and maintain a system of internal controls to monitor the Corporation's compliance with the laws and regulations applicable to advertising practices including, but not limited to, the Division's regulations 209 CMR 42.12A, the Office of the Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.00  et seq .  Shamrock Financial shall establish, implement and maintain policies and procedures to ensure that all advertisements are thoroughly reviewed by senior management prior to publication or distribution to consumers. Such procedures shall include a review of the criteria utilized to generate mailing lists to ensure that targeted solicitations are appropriate for the consumers to whom such solicitations are distributed.     BY ORDER AND DIRECTION OF THE COMMISSIONER OF BANKS.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MORTGAGE BROKER  LICENSING  Docket No. 2010-372  TEMPORARY  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  AND  NOTICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE  PENALTY  In the Matter of  COASTAL FINANCE, LLC  Quincy, Massachusetts  Mortgage Broker License No. MB5335  The Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") having determined that COASTAL FINANCE, LLC (""Coastal Finance"" or the ""Company"") located at 400 Crown Colony Drive, Suite 103, Quincy, Massachusetts has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST AND NOTICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTY (""Order"") pursuant to General Laws chapter 255E, section 7(b) and General Laws chapter 255E, section 11.  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (""Division""), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2.  Coastal Finance is, and at all relevant times, has been a limited liability company conducting business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Coastal Finance's main office is located at 400 Crown Colony Drive, Quincy, Massachusetts.  Coastal Finance is currently licensed by the Commissioner as a mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. According to the Division's records Coastal Finance was previously licensed by the Commissioner as mortgage lender and mortgage broker under Massachusetts General Laws 255E, section 2. According to records maintained by the Division, the Commissioner issued a mortgage company license, license number MC5160 to Coastal Finance to engage in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker on or about March 19, 2008. The Division's records indicate that on or around August 31, 2009, Coastal Finance opted to surrender its mortgage lender license and was thereafter assigned license number MB5335 to engage solely in the business of a mortgage broker in the Commonwealth.  License number MB5335 authorizes Coastal Finance to conduct the business of a mortgage broker from the Company's main office located at 400 Crown Colony Drive, Suite 103, Quincy, Massachusetts.  On or about October 1, 2010, the Division was forwarded a copy of a solicitation (""Solicitation"") received by a Massachusetts consumer from Coastal Finance. A copy of the Solicitation is attached as  Exhibit 1.    Misleading and Deceptive Advertising Practices  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a) states: 	 Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.  The Attorney General's regulation 940 CMR 8.04(1) states: 	 It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a mortgage broker or lender to make any representation or statement of fact in an advertisement if the representation or statement is false or misleading or has the tendency or capacity to be misleading, or if the mortgage broker or lender does not have sufficient information upon which a reasonable belief in the truth of the representation or statement could be based. Such claims or representations include, but are not limited to the availability, terms, conditions, or charges, incident to the mortgage transaction and the possibility of refinancing.  The Division's Regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(9) states: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker or mortgage lender to make false promises to influence, persuade, or induce a consumer to a sign a mortgage loan application or mortgage loan documents.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(4) states: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker to advertise any interest rate or loan term described in 209 CMR 32.24(3)(a) in any media without the following statement: ""We arrange but do not make loans"". No advertisement by a mortgage broker in any media shall contain language which indicates or suggests that the mortgage broker will fund or approve a mortgage loan or guarantee any rate.  The Division's review of the Solicitation revealed that it included several references which were misleading and deceptive, including references that gave the appearance that Coastal Finance is licensed as a mortgage lender in the Commonwealth. The Solicitation included certain references which collectively created an appearance that it was issued by a government agency by making references to the ""Economic Stimulus Act"" and the Company's ""FHA Lending Division.""  The Solicitation, marked ""Economic Stimulus Act 2010 - SECOND NOTICE"" advised the consumer that they had been selected by the Company's FHA lending division and were ""eligible to apply for a lower fixed rate, mortgage payment reduction, debt consolidation and/or receive cash out.""  The body of the Solicitation referenced a file number, and indicated that the Economic Stimulus Act allowed the Federal Housing Authority to ""temporarily adjust lending policies to soften the crises for mortgage holders and promote economic stimulus.""  The Solicitation further noted that Coastal Finance had previously attempted to contact the consumer and that this was a ""Second Notice."" The Solicitation instructed the consumer to respond immediately in order to take advantage before the program expired, and that the program would no longer be offered, effective October 4, 2010.  The Solicitation made reference to the consumer's current mortgage amount and notified the consumer that they had a ""high interest rate,"" and could qualify for one of three reduced payment options. The Solicitation identified monthly mortgage payments for a 30 year fixed, 15 year fixed and 5 year adjustable rate mortgage with the annual percentage rate identified. Coastal Finance also identified two ""cash out"" options for the consumer and identified an ""Estimated Escrow Refund,"" however failed to identify how the Company determined the Consumer's escrow refund as it was not the current mortgage holder. The Solicitation also did not include the statement, ""We arrange but do not make loans"" as required pursuant to 209 CMR 42.12A(4).  The Solicitation notified the consumer that if they began the transaction in September, their next payment ""may not be due until November,"" a statement that was misleading as it could lead the reader to believe that they would be skipping two mortgage payments.  Language indicating that the offer was being made by Coastal Finance and not a government agency was included in the Solicitation. However, such language was in font size that was significantly smaller than that of the body of the Solicitation and was located in a non prominent location at the bottom.  Based on the Division's records, Coastal Finance is not a government agency. 	 Failure to Disclose License Type and Number  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.15 states: 	 A Licensee shall disclose the type and number of its license(s) to all clients and/or residential mortgage loan applicants in writing at the time a fee is paid or a mortgage loan application is accepted. A Licensee shall also disclose the type and number of its license(s) in all advertisements.  The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(14) states: 	 It is a prohibited act or practice for a mortgage broker or mortgage lender for an employee or a person associated with and acting under the direction of a mortgage broker or a mortgage lender to advertise residential mortgage loan services without naming the licensee and disclosing the license number of the mortgage broker or mortgage lender under whose license the individual is acting.  The bottom of the Solicitation identified Coastal Finance as an FHA approved lender however did not include a reference to the type and license number held by Coastal Finance.  Coastal Finance is not currently licensed by the Commissioner to conduct business as a mortgage lender in Massachusetts under M.G.L. chapter 255E, section 2 and the Division's regulation 209 42.00  et seq. , and has not been since August of 2009. 	 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 21, Coastal Finance has failed to demonstrate and maintain the character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the mortgage broker business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 4 and the Division's regulations 209 CMR 42.06(2)(c).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 21, by mailing Massachusetts consumers a Solicitation that contained false or misleading language or language that had the tendency to be false or misleading, including language that could lead the reader to believe that the Solicitation was issued by a government agency, Coastal Finance has violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 2(a), and the Office of the Attorney General's implementing regulation 940 CMR 8.04(1).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 21, by mailing Massachusetts consumers a Solicitation that made false promises to influence, persuade or induce a consumer to sign a mortgage loan application, asserting the consumer's eligibility for a lower fixed rate a reduced payment on their original loan amount, and urging the consumer to respond to Coastal Finance immediately stating that program would expire, Coastal Finance violated the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.12A(9).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 21, by mailing Massachusetts consumers a Solicitation that failed to disclose Coastal Finance's license type and number, the Company violation the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.15 and 209 CMR 42.12A(14).  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 21, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 Coastal Finance has engaged in, is engaging in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that the public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to Coastal Finance.  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST AND NOTICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTY  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that Coastal Finance shall cease mailing the Solicitation identified as  Exhibit 1    and any Solicitation to Massachusetts consumers that contains any representations or statements that could be considered false, misleading, or have the tendency or capacity to be misleading including but not limited to: 	 Solicitations containing false or misleading language or language that had the tendency to be false or misleading, including language that could lead the reader to believe that the Solicitation was issued by a government agency;  Solicitations containing false or misleading language or language that had the tendency to be false or misleading, including language that could lead the reader to believe that the Solicitation was issued by a licensed mortgage lender;  Solicitations that have the tendency to make false promises to influence, persuade or induce a consumer to sign a mortgage loan application including references to the consumer's eligibility for a new fixed rate mortgage, lower monthly payments, and/or eligibility to skip 2 monthly payments.

The Division shall remit the payment for deposit into the General Fund of the Commonwealth.  The administrative penalty imposed on Coastal Finance is subject to review as provided in Massachusetts General Laws chapter 30A. Accordingly, Coastal Finance may request a hearing to contest said administrative penalty. Such request for a hearing must be filed in writing within 20 days of Coastal Finance's receipt of this Order. If the Company fails to request a hearing within the prescribed time frame pursuant to this Paragraph, the aforementioned administrative penalty shall be deemed final and binding and shall be due and owing to the Commonwealth.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing will be scheduled on this matter to determine whether or not such Order shall become permanent and final only upon receipt of a written request for such a hearing from Coastal Finance within twenty (20) days of the effective date of this Order. If no hearing is requested within this twenty (20) day period, this Order shall become permanent and final until it is modified or vacated by the Commissioner.

356,11/18/2021,2010,Final Order and Decision,"American Lending Group, Inc.",Mortgage Company,,,https://www.mass.gov/decision/american-lending-group-inc," COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  Suffolk, SS.  IN A MATTER  BEFORE THE COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  FINAL ORDER AND DECISION  DOCKET NUMBER: 2009-088  MASSACHUSETTS DIVISION OF BANKS  Boston, Massachusetts  Petitioner  vs.  AMERICAN LENDING GROUP, INC.  Saint Peters, Missouri  Respondent  Mortgage Company License No(s): MC5051 and MC5053  Appearance for Respondent:  Naren Chaganti, Esq.  713 The Hamptons Lane  Town & Country, MO 63017  Appearing for the Division of Banks:  Valerie Carbone, Esq.  Massachusetts Division of Banks  1000 Washington Street, 10  th  Floor  Boston, MA 02118  Designated Administrative Hearing Officer of the Commissioner of Banks:  Aimee Desai, Esq.  BACKGROUND  THIS MATTER was scheduled for hearing before the Office of the Commissioner of Banks (""Commissioner"") on September 20, 2010, pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 30A, sections 10 and 11 and the Standard Adjudicatory Rules of Practice and Procedure 801 CMR 1.01  et seq ., upon a Notice of Hearing which was mailed to the parties on August 24, 2010.  On September 15, 2010, American Lending Group, Inc., (""American Lending"" or ""Respondent"") through its counsel filed a motion requesting that the Corporation be excused from appearance at the hearing and indicated that: American Lending was no longer in business; American Lending had no funds to pay counsel for his time or travel; American Lending did not have any funds to pay for any witness to appear on its behalf; and American Lending had been administratively dissolved in Missouri.  In addition, on September 17, 2010, American Lending filed a Motion to Submit the Case on the Documents on File and having received no objection to ruling on the Motions and Documents filed from Division of Banks (""Division"" or ""Petitioner"") the following ruling is made on the Motions and Documents previously filed by the parties pursuant to 801 CMR 1.01(10)(c).  The Motions and Documents submitted by the parties include:  Exhibit 1:  Temporary Order to Cease and Desist issued by the Petitioner.  Exhibit 2:  Order to Show Cause and Notice of Right to a Hearing issued by the Petitioner.  Exhibit 3:  Letter sent by the Respondent Exercising its Right to a Hearing.  Exhibit 4:  Respondent's January 8, 2010 response to the Order to Show Cause and Notice of Right to a Hearing.  Exhibit 5:  Request to Appear by Telephone filed by American Lending.  Exhibit 6:  Written Argument of American Lending filed on August 5, 2010.  Exhibit 7  Division's response to the Respondent's Written Argument with three attachments:  Attachment 1:  Respondent's Licensing History.  Attachment 2:  Letter dated October 14, 2009 from American Lending requesting reconsideration of Administrative Penalty.  Attachment 3:  Letter dated November 12, 2009 issued by the Division denying American Lending's request for reconsideration.  Exhibit 8:  American Lending's response to the Division's response with three attachments:  Attachment 1:  Letter dated October 14, 2009 from American Lending requesting reconsideration of Administrative Penalty.  Attachment 2 : Letter dated November 12, 2009 issued by the Division denying American Lending's request for reconsideration.  Attachment 3:  Electronic mail correspondence from the Division to American Lending.  Exhibit 9:  American Lending's Request to Excuse Appearance at the Administrative Hearing.  Exhibit 10:  American Lending's Motion to Submit the Case on Documents on File.  The Division has requested that the Commissioner make a final decision addressing the following matters:  For a final Agency decision revoking American Lending's Massachusetts mortgage broker and mortgage lender license numbers MC5051 and MC5253;  For a final Agency decision ordering American Lending to pay a late fee assessed against the Respondent in the amount of $9,750 for the late filing of the Mortgage Lender/Mortgage Broker Annual Report for the period ending December 31, 2008;  For a final Agency decision awarding temporary and preliminary injunctive relief, and any other ancillary relief, as may be necessary to protect the public interest during the pendency of this matter;  For a final Agency decision in favor of the Division and against American Lending for each Charge set forth in the Order to Show Cause;  For a final Agency decision ordering American Lending to cease and desist from transacting business in Massachusetts as a mortgage broker and mortgage lender;  For a final Agency decision ordering American Lending to immediately place any pending residential mortgage loan applications and related files, if it has not already done so in accordance with the provisions of the Temporary Order, with an independent, licensed Massachusetts mortgage lender or other qualified lender in Massachusetts, with no costs to the applicant; and  For costs and fees of the Division's investigation of this matter.  American Lending has maintained that the relief requested by the Division is unwarranted because of the business turmoil that American Lending has endured, a lack of notification from the Division of the changes in regulations requiring a surety bond and furthermore that American Lending had offered to surrender its licenses in the final weeks of 2008 that would have made the regulatory action issued by the Division unnecessary.  THEREFORE, based upon the Motions and all Documents previously filed and the arguments of the parties and counsel, the Commissioner makes the following Findings of Fact and Conclusions:  FINDINGS OF FACT  On June 4, 2009, the Division issued a Temporary Order to Cease and Desist, Docket number 2009-088 (""Temporary Order"") against American Lending based upon: (Exhibit 1). 	 American Lending's failure to obtain, maintain and file a surety bond pursuant to the requirements of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.03(2)(a) and 209 CMR 42.06(2)(a);  The Respondent's failure to file financial statements pursuant to the requirements of the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.03(2)(b)(3) and 209 CMR 42.06(2)(b)(3); and  The Respondent's failure to file an annual report for calendar year 2008 pursuant to the requirements of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.10.  The Temporary Order afforded American Lending the right to request a hearing within twenty days (20) from the effective date of the Temporary Order. The hearing would be granted only upon a written request and if no such request was received the Temporary Order would become permanent. The Division alleges that American Lending did not request a hearing or respond to the Temporary Order which became permanent on June 25, 2009.  On November 19, 2009, the Division issued a notice to American Lending whereby the Respondent would be granted ten (10) days to file a surety bond and have the Permanent Order reconsidered by the Division.  The Division alleges that American Lending failed to respond to the November 19, 2009 correspondence and as a result on December 14, 2009, the Division issued an Order to Show Cause and Notice of a Right to a Hearing (""Order to Show Cause"") against American Lending which re-alleged the charges outlined in the Temporary Order. (Exhibit 2).  American Lending filed a request for a hearing on or about December 30, 2009, and filed a response to the Order to Show Cause on or about January 8, 2010. Respondent's counsel filed a Notice of Appearance on April 23, 2010. (Exhibit 3 and Exhibit 4).  By a letter dated July 7, 2010, the Administrative Hearings Department received notification from the Petitioner that efforts to settle the matter prior to the initiation of a formal administrative hearing had been unsuccessful and requested that a formal hearing be scheduled.  A Notice of Hearing was forwarded to all parties on July 14, 2010, and notified the parties that an Administrative Hearing (""Hearing"") had been scheduled for July 28, 2010. The Notice of Hearing required all parties to confirm their attendance via telephone.  On July 23, 2010, the Administrative Hearings Department contacted the Respondent's counsel to confirm American Lending's attendance at the July 28, 2010 Hearing as a telephone confirmation of attendance had not been received. American Lending's counsel indicated that the Respondent was unable to attend the Hearing in person. As a result, American Lending filed a Request to Appear by Telephone which was subsequently granted and notification was sent to all parties on July 26, 2010. (Exhibit 5).  On July 28, 2010, prior to the initiation of the Hearing which was conducted via teleconference, the Administrative Hearing Officer inquired as to whether the parties had attempted to settle the matter. The Division's counsel stated that efforts to settle the matter prior to its request to schedule an administrative hearing had been unsuccessful.  Upon the initiation of the Hearing, it became evident that Respondent's counsel had not reviewed correspondence sent by the Division beginning September 10, 2007, through April 30, 2009, to all licensed mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers, including American Lending, relating to the requirement that the licensees obtain a surety bond pursuant to amendments to the Division's regulations which became effective as of December 31, 2008. The Temporary Order which is incorporated into this Final Order outlined at least four notices that were sent by the Division to the Respondent regarding the surety bond matter. American Lending through its counsel also disputed certain findings of facts alleged in both the Temporary Order and the Order to Show Cause relating to the necessity of the maintenance of a surety bond. Respondent's counsel maintained that as a licensed mortgage lender and mortgage broker, American Lending was not required to maintain both a surety bond and a minimum net worth, a position that the Division disputed.  During the July 28, 2010 Hearing, Respondent's counsel also raised an argument related to the request by the Division that American Lending be ordered to pay an administrative penalty of the $9,750 for the late filing of the Respondent's 2008 Annual Report. American Lending maintained that the administrative penalty should be waived due to the business turmoil that American Lending had endured, and further stated that American Lending had no funds with which to pay the administrative penalty.  As the Respondent's counsel did not have the opportunity to review correspondence between the Division and American Lending prior to the July 28, 2010 Hearing, the Administrative Hearing Officer determined that the Hearing would be suspended and rescheduled after American Lending's counsel had the opportunity to review all correspondence between the parties and had submitted a written motion supporting its position.  American Lending was ordered to file a motion supporting its argument that there was justifiable cause for waiving the administrative penalty. Both parties were notified that upon review of the motion filed by the Respondent and any cross motions filed by the Petitioner, a determination would be made as to when the Hearing would be rescheduled, as it appeared as though the Respondent's counsel would need some time to review the regulations and statutes that were applicable to American Lending in the Commonwealth.  On August 24, 2010, the Administrative Hearing Officer forwarded a Notice of Hearing to both parties advising them that a Hearing was necessary to resolve the pending matter as both parties had filed several motions subsequent to the July 28, 2010 Hearing. The August 24, 2010 notice scheduled the Hearing for September 20, 2010. The Notice of Hearing ordered both parties to confirm their attendance with the Hearing Officer by September 7, 2010, and file a witness list by September 14, 2010. American Lending failed to comply with the Administrative Hearing Officer's order to both confirm attendance and submit a witness list within the time frames imposed.  On September 15, 2010, American Lending through counsel filed a Request to Excuse Appearance at the Hearing. Respondent's counsel was contacted by the Administrative Hearings Department to request a clarification of the September 15, 2010 request filed by the Respondent. American Lending notified the Administrative Hearing Department that a Request to Submit the Case on the Documents on File would be filed imminently.  The Request to Submit the Case on the Documents was filed on September 17, 2010. As the Request was filed on the last business day before the scheduled Hearing, a brief Hearing was conducted on September 20, 2010, only to confirm that the Petitioner had received the Request filed by the Respondent and had no formal objection to a Final Order and Decision being made on the Motions and Documents previously filed by both parties. The Petitioner raised no objection to the Respondent's Motion. (Exhibit 9 and Exhibit 10). 	 CONCLUSION  The Division is an agency of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and was created pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 26, section 1. Through the Commissioner, the Division has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons and entities engaged in the business of a mortgage lender and mortgage broker in Massachusetts pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 42.00 et seq., which are administered by the Commissioner.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 6 provides that the Commissioner may suspend or revoke a licensed mortgage lender or mortgage brokers license if there has been a violation of the chapter or any rule or regulation adopted thereunder, or any other law applicable to the conduct of its business. 	 Failure to File Annual Report and Imposition of Administrative Penalty  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8 requires all licensees to file an annual report within a time frame prescribed by the Commissioner. The Division's regulation 209 CMR 42.10 requires all mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers to file an annual report with the Commissioner in such form as the Commissioner shall prescribe for the previous calendar year, by March 31.  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255E, section 8 also states that a licensee that neglects to file an annual report within fifteen days of notice directing the same shall pay to the commonwealth fifty dollars for each day that the action continues unless it is due to justifiable cause and not due to willful neglect.  General Laws chapter 255E, section 8 states in part: 	 Each licensee shall annually, on or before a date determined by the commissioner, file a report with the commissioner containing such information as said commissioner may require concerning the business and operations conducted by the licensee in the commonwealth during the preceding calendar year. A licensee neglecting to file such report or failing to amend the same within fifteen days of notice from said commissioner directing the same shall, unless such neglect or failure is due to justifiable cause and not due to willful neglect, pay to the commonwealth fifty dollars for each day during which such neglect or failure continues.  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.10 states: 	 By March 31, each Licensee shall file an annual report with the Commissioner in such form as the Commissioner shall prescribe for the preceding calendar year. The annual report shall be in writing, subscribed by the Licensee under the pains and penalty of perjury.  The Division has alleged that American Lending failed to file an Annual Report for calendar year 2008, by March 31, 2009, despite notices that were forwarded to American Lending on October 30, 2008 and February 20, 2009 and additional notifications that were sent to the Respondent by the issuance of both the Temporary Order and Order to Show Cause. The Division contends that American Lending filed an annual report on or about October 12, 2009 and has requested that American Lending be ordered to pay $9,750 pursuant to the provisions of General Laws chapter 255E, section 8 for the late filing of the annual report.  American Lending has argued that the late filing fee of $9,750 should be waived due to justifiable cause because American Lending is currently in business turmoil. American Lending also alleges that it offered not to renew its mortgage lender and mortgage broker license in the last few weeks of 2008. American Lending maintains that based on a conversation that the Respondent had with the Division's staff, the Corporation believed that any discipline as a result of the delay would be waived. The Division disputed this position in its response by stating that there was never an indication that the late filing of an Annual Report would have ""no regulatory repercussions."" (Exhibit 6, Exhibit 7 and Exhibit 10).  American Lending's response to the Division's response filed on August 12, 2010 included three attachments; an October 14, 2010 letter to the Division, a November 12, 2009 letter from the Division to American Lending denying its request for reconsideration of the penalty; and an e-mail sent by the Division's licensing department to American Lending on September 25, 2009. (Exhibit 8).  A review of the Motions and Documents on the record does not substantiate American Lending's argument that justifiable cause for waiving the penalty does in fact exist. The basis of American Lending's argument is that the Division ""erred in imposing a strict liability and completely ignored mitigating factors."" American Lending has maintained that as it is currently in business turmoil, the administrative penalty imposed should be waived. General Laws chapter 255E, section 8 provides that an administrative penalty for failure file a report shall be imposed unless the licensed entity neglects to file a report due to justifiable cause and not willful neglect. A review of the documents and filings, including the licensing history, indicates that American Lending was notified of the March 31, 2009, deadline for filing the Annual Report on at least two separate occasions prior to the issuance of the Temporary Order and Order to Show Cause. The Division's Temporary Order alleges that correspondence sent on October 30, 2008, and February 20, 2009, to American Lending notified the Respondent that a $50.00 per day late fee would be incurred for a late filing. Additionally, American Lending's argument that it offered to surrender its mortgage lender and mortgage broker license thereby deeming the administrative penalty and regulatory action unnecessary is irrelevant, as the information reflected on the Annual Report would be for its volume of business for calendar year 2008, a time in which American Lending maintained a license in the Commonwealth.  A review of the Respondent's licensing history available through the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System (""NMLS"") and provided by the Division in its response, indicates that on December 30, 2008, a representative of American Lending formally requested a renewal of the Respondent's mortgage lender and mortgage broker license through NMLS. This is contrary to the Respondent's position that it offered not to renew its license ""in the final weeks of 2008."" The Respondent's license renewal was subsequently approved on April 21, 2009. An October 14, 2009 letter sent by the President of American Lending that was an attachment to both parties' filings (Exhibit 7, Attachment 2 and Exhibit 8, Attachment 1) further states that the Respondent was in contact with the Division's licensing department and had requested a surrender of the licenses around March 3, 2009. However the same letter acknowledged that American Lending had not formally requested the surrender of licenses through NMLS. Additionally, American Lending would have been aware of the April 21, 2009, renewal approval through NMLS, yet according to information submitted on the record, the Respondent made no attempt to request a surrender of its mortgage lender and mortgage broker licenses at that time.  American Lending's Written Argument filed on August 5, 2010, states that American Lending had ceased operating in the Commonwealth after December 2008, a statement that was disputed by the Division in a Response filed by the Division which included publically available registry of deeds records that identify the Respondent as the mortgage lender of record during calendar year 2009. In a response filed by American Lending's counsel on August 12, 2010, the Respondent argued that the mortgage documents recorded at the registry of deeds that identified American Lending as the mortgage lender of record were merely ""renewal[s] of previously underwritten loans."" It is unclear what Respondent's counsel defines as a ""renewal of a previously underwritten loan"" other than to assume that counsel in fact meant to indicate that the mortgage loans were refinances, which would support the Division's contention that the Respondent was engaged in the business of a mortgage lender pursuant to the provisions of General Laws chapter 255E, section 2. 	 Surety Bond Requirement  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.03(2)(a) and 209 CMR 42.06(2)(a) requires all licensed mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers to obtain a surety bond as a condition of licensure.  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.03(2)(a) applicable to mortgage lenders states in part: 	 License Requirements. An Applicant shall be required to submit detailed information supporting the following general requirements:  a bond in a sum to be based on the amount of the Applicant's aggregate mortgage loans, as determined by the Commissioner, but in no event shall the sum of the bond be less than $100,000, up to a maximum of $500,000…  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 42.06(2)(a) applicable to mortgage brokers states in part: 	 License Requirements. An Applicant shall be required to submit detailed information supporting the following general requirements:  a bond of $75,000 in such form and with such sureties as may be approved by the Commissioner...  The Division alleges that amendments to the regulation at 209 CMR 42.00  et seq., implementing the requirement of a surety bond for the maintenance of a license, followed a public hearing that was held on July 10, 2007, and a subsequent 10 day comment period. The Division forwarded all licensed mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers a notification letter on or about September 10, 2007 advising them of the requirement and notifying them that a bond would have to be secured by December 31, 2008. The Division also alleges that at least three additional notices were mailed to all licensees, including American Lending. A notice was sent or about October 30, 2008 reiterating the December 31, 2008 deadline; a letter was sent on or about February 20, 2009 providing instructions to licensees that required them to mail a notarized surety bond by March 31, 2009; and an additional notice was sent around April 30, 2009 that provided all licensees with additional time in which to comply with the Division's regulations and required all licensees to obtain and provide evidence of a bond by May 15, 2009.  American Lending maintains that it failed to secure a bond because: the Corporation was allegedly relying on a ""prior law that required either a net worth of $100,000 or a surety bond;"" that there was a lack of notice from the Division of the changes in the regulations that would require the maintenance of a bond; and that the Division was aware of the fact that ""insurance companies were not underwriting any bond applications,"" a statement that the Division disputed by maintaining that it had no such knowledge and that ""the vast majority of mortgage companies were able to secure the corporate bonds as required."" American Lending also alleges that it offered not to renew its mortgage lender and mortgage broker license in the last few weeks of 2008, and the Division was at fault for renewing a license application without the necessary bond. (Exhibit 6, Exhibit 7 and Exhibit 10).  A review of the Motions and Documents on the record indicate that the argument that the Respondent was relying on a previous statute is unfounded and clearly contrary to the Respondent's written statements to the Division. The NMLS system requires all licensees seeking renewal of their mortgage lender and mortgage broker license to complete a ""renewals attestation form"" signed by a representative of the licensee under oath. The license renewal history that was provided by the Division indicates that American Lending submitted request for renewal of the Corporation's license on or about December 30, 2008. An authorized representative of American Lending would have had to complete the attestation form that states in part: ""As part of this request for license/registration renewal, I swear and affirm to the following: The licensee is in compliance with any surety bond (or approved alternative) requirements(s) of the jurisdiction(s) being request to renew its license/registration.""  An October 14, 2009 letter submitted by American Lending as an attachment to its August 12, 2010 filing during this hearing (Exhibit 8, Attachment 1 ) was sent to the Division by the President of American Lending that stated the Corporation was having great difficulty in securing bond coverage and that the Corporation's bond had been cancelled on March 3, 2009. The record also reflects that American Lending was notified on at least four separate occasions, of the surety bond requirement. Correspondence was sent to all licensed mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers by the Division on September 10, 2007, October 30, 2008, February 20, 2009 and April 30, 2009.  The October 14, 2009 correspondence from the Respondent, further states that American Lending was in contact with the Division's licensing department and had requested a surrender of the license around March 3, 2009, however the letter acknowledged that the request was not formally requested through NMLS, and American Lending group did not follow up, a statement that contradicts the Respondent's Written Argument filed on August 5, 2010 which states that the Corporation offered to not renew the license in the last few weeks of 2008. American Lending also would have been aware of the April 21, 2009 renewal approval through NMLS and according to information submitted on the record, the Respondent did not thereafter file a request to surrender its license.  The Respondent's Written Argument filed on August 5, 2010 indicated that since American Lending had ceased operating in the Commonwealth after December 2008 a surety bond would not have been necessary, a statement that is disputed by the Division in a Response filed by the Petitioner which included publically available registry of deeds records that identify the Respondent as the mortgage lender of record during calendar year 2009. 	 ORDER AND DECISION  American Lending's mortgage lender and mortgage broker license numbers MC5051 and MC5253 are hereby permanently revoked for violations of General Laws chapter 255E, section 8, the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 42.10, 209 CMR 42.03(2)(a) and 209 CMR 42.06(2)(a). Therefore, American Lending is ordered to cease and desist from transacting business in Massachusetts as a mortgage lender and mortgage broker.  American Lending is hereby ordered to pay an Administrative Penalty in the amount of $9,750 for the late filing of an Annual Report for calendar year 2008 pursuant to the provisions of General Laws chapter 255E, section 8.  American Lending is ordered to immediately place any pending residential mortgage loan applications and related files with an independent licensed mortgage lender or other qualified lender in Massachusetts, with no costs to the applicant.  The Division's request for costs and fees for the investigation of this matter is hereby denied.  This Final Decision and Order may be appealed by filing a written petition for judicial review within thirty (30) days after entry of this Final Order and Decision, pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 30A, sections 14 and 15.     BY ORDER AND DIRECTION OF THE COMMISSIONER OF BANKS.

365,12/22/2021,2010,Consent Order,"Braz Transfers, Inc.",Foreign Transmittal Agency,,,https://www.mass.gov/temporary-order-to-cease-and-desist/braz-transfers-inc," COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  Suffolk, SS.  COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  FOREIGN TRANSMITTAL AGENCY LICENSING  AND  CHECK CASHER LICENSING  Docket No. 2013-015  FINDINGS OF FACT AND  TEMPORARY ORDER TO  CEASE AND DESIST  In the Matter of  BRAZ TRANSFERS, INC.  Saugus, Massachusetts  Foreign Transmittal Agency License No(s): FT4449 et al.  and  Check Casher License No.: CC111542-353  The Commissioner of Banks (Commissioner) having determined that BRAZ TRANSFERS, INC., (Braz Transfers or the Corporation) located at 999 Broadway, Suite 500, Saugus, Massachusetts has engaged, or is engaged in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices constituting violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapters 169 and 169A, and applicable regulations found at 209 CMR 44.00 and 209 CMR 45.00  et seq. , hereby issues the following TEMPORARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST (Temporary Order) pursuant to General Laws chapter 169, section 13(b) and chapter 169A, section 9(b).  FINDINGS OF FACT  The Division of Banks (Division), through the Commissioner, has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons engaged in the business of a foreign transmittal agency pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169.  The Division also has jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of persons engaged in the business of a check casher pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169A.  Braz Transfers is, and at all relevant times has been, a corporation conducting business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Braz Transfer’s main office is located at 999 Broadway, Suite 500, Saugus, Massachusetts.  According to the Division’s records, Sostenas Souza is the President, Chief Executive Officer and fifty percent shareholder of Braz Transfers.  According to the Division’s records, Deneir Rosa is the Treasurer and fifty percent shareholder of Braz Transfers.  Braz Transfers is licensed by the Commissioner as a foreign transmittal agency under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a foreign transmittal license to Braz Transfers on or about June 16, 2004, with license number FT3346. License number FT3346 authorized Braz Transfers to operate as a foreign transmittal agency at 144 Maverick Street, East Boston, Massachusetts.  Braz Transfers maintains a total of ninety-three (93) foreign transmittal agency licenses for 93 agents, for locations operated in the Commonwealth from which the Corporation conducts its foreign transmittal business.  Braz Transfers is a money services business as defined by The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and its implementing regulation at 31 C.F.R. Chapter X.  Braz Transfers is also licensed as a check casher under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169A. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a check casher license to Braz Transfers on or about September 2, 2011, with license number CC111542-353. License number CC111542-353 authorized Braz Transfers to operate as a check casher at 377 Somerville Avenue, Somerville, Massachusetts.  Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169, section 10 and chapter 169A, section 10, the Division commenced an inspection of the books, accounts, papers, records, and files of Braz Transfers on February 5, 2013 (2013 examination). 	 A. Regulatory Background  On December 2, 2010 ,  pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169, section 13(b), the Division issued a Temporary Order to Cease and Desist (Order) against two authorized agent locations of Braz Transfers, Docket Number, 2010-375 based on findings of a November 29, 2009 examination. The Order issued by the Division alleged significant failures to comply with applicable state and federal laws, rules, regulations, and regulatory guidelines governing the conduct of two of Braz Transfer’s authorized agents engaged in the foreign transmittal business in the Commonwealth.  The Order alleged that the Division’s examiners reviewed certain information during an examination that indicated that Massachusetts consumer funds were transmitted through an entity that was unrelated to Braz Transfers or any other licensed money remitter from two of Braz Transfers agent locations. Additionally, the funds were remitted to Brazil through what appeared to be an unauthorized foreign agent in Brazil.  On July 6, 2011, Braz Transfers entered into a STIPULATION AND CONSENT TO THE ISSUANCE OF A CONSENT ORDER (Consent Order) with representatives of the Division, to resolve matters identified in the Order. The provisions of the Consent Order required Braz Transfers to establish, implement and maintain appropriate procedures to ensure compliance with laws and regulations applicable to the foreign transmittal business. The Consent Order is incorporated herein by reference. 	 B. Failure To Demonstrate the Financial Responsibility, Character, Reputation Integrity, and General Fitness to Maintain a License  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169, section 12 relevant to the licensing of foreign transmittal agencies states: 	 The commissioner may suspend or revoke any license issued pursuant to this chapter if he finds that: (a) the licensee has violated any provision of this chapter or any rule or regulation adopted hereunder or any other law applicable to the conduct of such business; or (b) any fact or condition exists which, if it had existed at the time of the original application for such license, would have warranted the commissioner to refuse to issue such license.  The Division’s regulation at 209 CMR 44.04(2) states in part: 	 (a) The Commissioner may deny an application to engage in the business of foreign transmittal agency, if the Commissioner upon review of the application and other relevant information, determines that the Applicant has not satisfied the requirements of M.G.L. c. 169 or 209 CMR 44.03.  (b) The Commissioner may also deny such an application if the Applicant has:  1. violated any provision of M.G.L. c. 169 or 209 CMR 44.00;  2. violated or engaged in a pattern of violations of any state or federal law applicable to the conduct of the business of a foreign transmittal agency and any rule, regulation or administrative order or directive promulgated thereunder;  3. conducted, or will conduct, its business in an unsafe and unsound manner...  Books and records reviewed by the Division’s examiners during the 2013 examination revealed that Braz Transfers failed to maintain the financial responsibility, character, reputation and integrity to conduct the foreign transmittal business in the Commonwealth as the Corporation conducted the foreign transmittal business in an unsafe and unsound manner by providing falsified records to Division’s examiners, including falsified receipts of transfers allegedly made by Braz Transfers on behalf of Massachusetts consumers as specifically enumerated in this Temporary Order. 	 i. Falsification of Records Provided to the Division  Massachusetts General Laws chapter 169, section 8 states, in part: 	 All money received for transmission to a foreign country by any licensee shall be forwarded to the person to whom the same is directed within seven days following receipt thereof...  The Division’s regulation 209 CMR 44.10(5) states: 	 Grounds for license revocation under M.G.L. c. 169, § 12 and the issuance of cease and desist orders under M.G.L. c. 169, § 13 shall include, but are not limited to, the following prohibited acts and practices by Licensees:  (5) failing to forward all money received for transmission to a foreign country to the person to whom the same is directed within seven days following receipt thereof.  Braz Transfers transmits money received from Massachusetts consumers primarily to Brazil. According to information reflected on the Corporation’s 2012 annual report filed with the Division, Braz Transfers transmitted $122,932,273.59 for Massachusetts consumers for calendar year 2012.  During the 2013 examination, the Division’s examiners requested records reflecting proof of payment receipts for the following time periods: February 10, 2011 through February 11, 2011, November 16, 2011 through November 18, 2011 and November 28, 2012 through November 30, 2012. In addition, the Division’s examiners requested and were provided proof of payment receipts from February 13, 2013 through February 20, 2013.  The Central Bank of Brazil authorizes and supervises the operations of foreign agents conducting business in Brazil. The Division’s review of the directory of agents authorized to engage in foreign exchange transactions in Brazil available from the Central Bank of Brazil, indicates that two agent relationships currently maintained by Braz Transfers are authorized banks in Brazil, Bank Rendimento and Banco Paulista, S.A.  The Division’s examiners review of the proof of payment receipts provided by Braz Transfers indicated that Massachusetts consumer funds were transmitted through either Bank Rendimento or Banco Paulista, S.A. The receipts provided by Braz Transfers appeared to have been generated by either Bank Rendimento or Banco Paulista, S.A.  During the examination, the Division’s examiners contacted representatives at both Bank Rendimento and Banco Paulista, S.A., to request their assistance in verifying a sample of transactions that Braz Transfers represented had been remitted through both institutions. Both Banks cooperated fully with the Division’s requests and agreed to review the information provided by the Division.  On February 26, 2013, the Division’s examiners forwarded a representative of Banco Rendimento information on 40 transactions that Braz Transfers represented had been remitted through the Bank to the beneficiary in Brazil. On February 27, 2013 ,  a representative of Banco Rendimento notified the Division’s examiners that 21 of the 40 transactions had not been remitted through Banco Rendimento.  On February 27, 2013, the Division’s examiners forwarded a representative of Banco Paulista, S.A., information on 20 transactions that Braz Transfers indicated had been remitted through the Bank to the beneficiary in Brazil. On March 4, 2013, a representative of Banco Paulista, S.A. notified the Division’s examiners that 11 of the 20 transactions had not been remitted through Banco Paulista, S.A.  The Division’s examiners also forwarded the representative of Banco Rendimento a copy of the proof of payment receipt provided by Braz Transfers to confirm its authenticity. On February 27, 2013, the representative from Banco Rendimento notified the Division’s examiners that the receipt submitted for review had not been issued by Banco Rendimento.  On March 19, 2013 and March 20, 2013, based upon the information received by representatives at Banco Rendimento and Banco Paulista, S.A. the Division’s examiners conducted a meeting with the Chief Compliance Officer and the Assistant Compliance Officer of Braz Transfers to discuss the concerns raised in Paragraphs 20 through 26 of this Temporary Order.  During both meetings, representatives of Braz Transfers did not dispute the information referenced in Paragraphs 20 through 26 of this Temporary Order.  On March 22, 2013, the Division received an email from representatives at Banco Paulista, S.A. stating that the institution had attempted to contact Braz Transfers regarding the irregularities in transactions and had requested a response by March 7, 2013. As of March 22, 2013, Braz Transfers had failed to respond to Banco Paulista, S.A’s request. As a result, Banco Paulista notified Braz Transfers and the Division that their existing contract with Braz Transfers would be terminated as of April 26, 2013.  As of the date of this Temporary Order, Braz Transfers has failed to demonstrate that funds received for transmissions from Massachusetts consumers were remitted to their intended recipient within 7 days or at all. It is unknown how many Massachusetts consumers have been affected by Braz Transfers’ failure to transmit funds through authorized institutions in Brazil, or if the practice is continuing to date. 	 ii. Failure to Notify the Division of Change in Ownership or Personnel  The Division’s regulation at 209 CMR 44.08 states in part: 	 If any change occurs in the ownership of a Licensee, or in the name or residential address of the Licensee, or the office manager or of the person or persons in charge of an office, a notice shall forthwith be filed with the Commissioner who may thereupon cause such investigation to be made as he deems necessary, as if it were a new license. In the case of a Licensee which is a corporation, a change in the ownership of 10% or more of the stock thereof shall subject such corporation to the provisions of the preceding sentence.  During the March 20, 2013, meeting referenced in Paragraph 27 of this Temporary Order, representatives of Braz Transfers provided the Division’s examiners a letter of resignation signed by Sostenas Souza and dated February 12, 2013. To date, the Corporation has failed to appropriately notify the Division of Sostenas Souza’s resignation.  On March 26, 2013, due to the concerns raised in Paragraphs 20 through 30 of this Temporary Order, the Division’s representatives held a meeting with Deneir Rosa and other representatives of the Corporation to discuss the concerns raised in this Temporary Order.  During the meeting, representatives of the Division were notified that the Corporation had undergone significant changes in management.  As of the date of this Temporary Order, Braz Transfers has failed to submit any written notification of any of the additional changes in management.  Due to the Corporation's failure to notify the Division of any of the aforementioned changes in senior management, the Division is unable to evaluate the condition of the Corporation. 	 Conclusions of Law  Based on the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 36, by providing the Division’s examiners with falsified records and proof of payment receipts, Braz Transfers has failed to demonstrate the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and soundly in the public interest in violation of General Laws chapter 169, section 6, the Division’s regulation 209 CMR 44.03, and the Division’s regulation 209 CMR 44.04.  Based on the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 36, Braz Transfers, failed to ensure that funds received for transmissions to Brazil were remitted in violation of General Laws chapter 169 section 8 and the Division’s regulation 209 CMR 44.10(5).  Based on the information in Paragraphs 1 through 36, Braz Transfers failed to notify the Division of changes in management at the office, in violation of the Division’s regulation 209 CMR 44.08.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 36, the public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an Order to Cease and Desist under General Laws chapter 169, section 13(b) because, upon information and belief, Braz Transfers has collected funds from Massachusetts consumers that may not have been transmitted to beneficiaries in Brazil.  As of the date of this Temporary Order, Braz Transfers has failed to demonstrate that those funds received for transmission from Massachusetts consumers were remitted to their intended recipient within 7 days or at all, and it is unknown if this is a continuing practice, that could possibly affect a growing number of Massachusetts consumers.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 36, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of Braz Transfers original foreign transmittal agency license applications, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such licenses.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 36, had the facts and conditions found therein existed at the time of Braz Transfers original check casher license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 36, the Commissioner has determined that: 	 Braz Transfers has engaged, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that the Corporation is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a foreign transmittal agency including, but not limited to, the provisions under General Laws chapter 169 and the Division’s regulations at 209 CMR 44.00  et seq .  Braz Transfers has engaged, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that the Corporation is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a licensed check casher including, but not limited to, the provisions under General Laws chapter 169A and the Division’s regulations at 209 CMR 45.00  et seq .  The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to Braz Transfers.  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  After taking into consideration the FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that Braz Transfers, any and all officers, directors, employees, independent contractors, or agents operating on behalf of Braz Transfers, and their successors or assigns, shall immediately cease engaging directly or indirectly in the business of a foreign transmittal agency in Massachusetts, as defined in General Laws chapter 169, section 1, except as otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Temporary Order or by the Commissioner.

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Braz Transfers shall immediately process and remit all transmittal orders for funds received from Massachusetts consumers with no loss to the consumer.  It being understood that ""no loss to the consumer"" shall mean that if the Corporation is unable to remit funds collected for transmittal, the consumer shall be entitled to a refund of all funds and any fees collected by Braz Transfers. Braz Transfers shall submit a detailed record to evidence compliance of this Paragraph in conjunction with the Report submitted to the Division as outlined in Paragraph 48 of this Temporary Order.

COMMISSIONER OF BANKS  MOTOR VEHICLE SALES FINANCE COMPANY LICENSING  Docket No. 2010-228  ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST,  ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE AND  NOTICE OF INTENT TO REVOKE  MOTOR VEHICLE SALES FINANCE COMPANY LICENSE  In the Matter of  INOFIN, INC.  Rockland, Massachusetts  Motor Vehicle Sales Finance Company  License No. MV0147  ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLAINT  The Commonwealth of Massachusetts Division of Banks (the ""Division""), by and through the Commissioner of Banks of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the ""Commissioner""), for its Order to Cease and Desist, Order to Show Cause and Notice of Intent to Revoke (""Order and Notice""), alleges as follows:  The Division brings this action under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255B, section 7 to revoke Inofin, Inc.'s (""Inofin"" or the ""Corporation"") motor vehicle sales finance company license MV0147 and to obtain other equitable relief as may be necessary due to Inofin's failure to comply with the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255B and failure to maintain and exercise the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity, and general fitness that would warrant the belief that its business will be operated honestly, fairly, soundly, and efficiently in the public interest in violation of Massachusetts General Laws, chapter 255B, section 2 and the Division's regulation 209 CMR 20.03. JURISDICTION AND VENUE  The Division is an agency of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts with jurisdiction over matters relating to the licensing and regulation of those engaged in the business of a motor vehicle sales finance company pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255B, section 2.  At all relevant times, Inofin has been engaged in the business of a motor vehicle sales finance company in Massachusetts. RESPONDENT  Inofin is, and at all relevant times has been, a corporation conducting business in the Commonwealth with its main office located at 55 Accord Park Drive, Unit D, Rockland, Massachusetts.  Inofin is licensed by the Commissioner as a motor vehicle sales finance company under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255B section 2. According to records maintained on file with the Division, the Commissioner initially issued a motor vehicle sales finance company license, number MV0147 on or about September 12, 1994.  According to the Division's records, Inofin's motor vehicle sales finance company license, number MV0147 expired as of October 31, 2010 and has been in a ""non renewal"" status as of that date. FINDINGS OF FACT AND REGULATORY ACTION BACKGROUND A. Uncertainty of Inofin's Ability to Meet the Minimum Financial Requirements for Holding a Motor Vehicle Sales Finance Company License in Massachusetts and Failure to Provide Certain Requested Information  The Division's regulation at 209 CMR 20.03(2)(a) states  	Financial responsibility. An Applicant shall demonstrate and provide the commissioner with evidence of its financial responsibility and submit a sworn statement which states that the Applicant meets the following requirements:  	2. An Applicant for a license under M.G.L. c. 255B shall demonstrate that, after all organization and other initial expenses have been paid, it has a net worth equal to at least $20,000. The minimum net worth requirement may be waived by the commissioner when a license is being renewed. If the commissioner approves an Applicant under M.G.L. c. 255B, he may, in his discretion, require the Licensee to furnish a bond in a sum not to exceed $10,000 executed by the Licensee and by a surety company approved by the commissioner conditioned upon the faithful performance by the Licensee of the duties and obligations pertaining to the business so licensed  	It is noted the Commissioner has not waived the net worth requirement, as referenced in the above mentioned statute.  Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255B, section 3, the Division is authorized to inspect the books, accounts, papers, records, and files of motor vehicle sales finance companies transacting business in Massachusetts to determine compliance with the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255B and any rule, or regulation issued thereunder, and with any law, rule, or regulation applicable to the conduct of the business of a motor vehicle sales finance company.  On November 9, 2009, pursuant to the authority granted under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255B, section 3, the Division commenced an examination/inspection of the books, accounts, papers, records, and files maintained by Inofin to evaluate the Corporation's compliance with the laws and regulations applicable to the conduct of a motor vehicle sales finance company business in Massachusetts (the ""examination/inspection"").  During the examination/inspection of Inofin's books and records the Division became concerned with the Corporation's ability to meet the minimum financial requirements for holding a motor vehicle sales finance company license in Massachusetts.  On or about June 8, 2010 and June 9, 2010, as a result of continuing concerns relative to the financial condition of the Corporation, the Division's supervisory management participated with the Division's examiners and continued an onsite review of Inofin's books and records.  Based upon the Division's continued concerns, on June 18, 2010, the Commissioner and Inofin entered into a Stipulation and Consent to the Issuance of a Consent Order, Docket No. 2010-225, (the ""Consent Order"") to address the matters raised during the examination/inspection of Inofin's books and records. The Consent Order is attached hereto as Exhibit 1. B. Material Failure to Comply with the Terms of the Consent Order  Section 6 of the Consent Order states:  	Within forty-eight (48) hours of the effective date of this Consent Order, Inofin shall engage an Accounting Firm (""Firm"") to prepare and submit to the Division an audit of the financial statements for the year 2009 and issue an Opinion Audit (""Audit"") in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, the Accounting Firm shall prepare and submit to the Division, an audited 2008 year-end balance sheet and a 2008 income statement review. The accounting firm previously retained by Inofin shall not be eligible to be retained as the Firm for purposes of this Consent Order. It being understood that Inofin shall obtain the prior written approval from the Commissioner of the Firm to be utilized by the Corporation. The Firm's review shall commence immediately upon approval of the Commissioner.  Sections 1 and 2 of the Consent Order state:  	Within forty-eight (48) hours of the effective date of this Consent Order, Inofin shall identify an independent consultant (""Consultant"") as an interim manager to oversee, direct and coordinate, the operations of the Corporation. It being understood that Inofin shall obtain the prior written approval from the Commissioner of the Consultant proposed by the Corporation. Inofin shall provide written notification of a proposed Consultant and thereafter submit to the Commissioner a proposed engagement letter that identifies the scope of services to be provided by the Consultant, which at a minimum conforms with the requirements set forth in Section 2 of this Consent Order.  	The Consultant appointed by Inofin at a minimum shall render the following services:  	a. Manage and oversee the operations of the Corporation including but not limited to the servicing operations;  	b. Oversee the financial reporting and reconciliation of all accounts maintained by Inofin; and  	c. Ensure the Corporation's compliance in responding to any requests made by the Division.  Section 3 of the Consent Order states:  	The Consultant shall ensure that Inofin continues to pay all obligations due to Investors pursuant to the terms of any Agreements.  Section 12 of the Consent Order states:  	Failure to comply with the terms of this Order shall constitute grounds for license suspension and/or revocation pursuant to applicable provisions of the General Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  Section 10 of the Consent Order states:  	Nothing in this Order shall be construed as permitting Inofin to violate any law, rule, regulation, or regulatory bulletin to which Inofin is subject.  As of the date of this Order and Notice, Inofin is in substantial non compliance with certain provisions of the Consent Order. Inofin has failed to provide required documentation concerning the audit and operations within the time-frames set forth in the Consent Order.  In accordance with the provisions of Section 6 of the Consent Order, Inofin was required to engage an accounting firm to prepare and submit to the Division, an audit of the financial statements for the year 2009 and an audited 2008 year-end balance sheet and a 2008 income statement review.  On December 14, 2010, during a meeting with representatives of the Division, Inofin notified the Division that while the Corporation entered into an agreement with an accounting firm to prepare the audit, the audit had not been completed in accordance with the provisions of the Consent Order and would not be submitted to the Division. The Corporation stated the audit could not be completed due to several nuances concerning certain valuations. During discussions with the Division, the Corporation notified the Division that representatives of the Corporation had terminated the engaged approved accounting firm and been aware of the matter for approximately one week. The Division was not notified of this development and documentation relative to the termination was requested by the Division. To date, this information has not been received. In addition, the Corporation engaged another accounting firm that was not approved by the Division to complete a limited scope, non-opinion audit as of December 31, 2009, that was not to the terms outlined in the Consent Order, no later than December 17, 2010.  A copy of the limited scope non-opinion audit from the non-approved accounting firm was received by the Division on December 17, 2010. The limited scope audit showed that the Corporation had a negative net worth of approximately $29 million as of December 31, 2009.  On or about December 23, 2010, the Division was informed that Inofin had terminated its contractual arrangement with the consultant required to be in place under the terms of the Consent Order. Notification of this termination was not provided to the Division. The consultant was a requirement under the Consent Order and Inofin's actions in terminating these services is a violation of Sections 1 and 2 of the Consent Order.  On December 14, 2010, the Corporation stated it was no longer able to meet several of its contractual obligations in violation of Section 3 of the Consent Order.  As a result of Corporation's admission of the not being able to meets its financial obligations and the submission of a limited scope non-opinion audit showing a significant negative net worth position, it does not appear that Inofin has met the financial requirements to hold a motor vehicle sales finance company license.  Due to inability of Division examiners to determine the financial condition during the onsite examination as well as subsequent review by Division management coupled with the uncertainty regarding if and when the approved audit would be completed, a determination of when the Division would be able to evaluate the financial condition of the Corporation remains unclear. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 25, Inofin has failed to demonstrate that its financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity and general fitness are such as to command the confidence of the public and to warrant the belief that the motor vehicle sales finance business will be operated lawfully, honestly and fairly, in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255B, section 2 and the Division's regulations 209 CMR 20.03.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 25, Inofin is in substantial non compliance with the Consent Order and failed to immediately notify the Commissioner of the inability to complete the audit as required, its inability to meet contractual obligations, and its termination of the services of the consultant.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 25, the public interest will be harmed by delay in issuing an Order to Cease and Desist because, upon information and belief, Inofin has a portfolio of Massachusetts retail installment loans the Corporation is currently servicing which require immediate action to protect the interests of any affected Massachusetts consumers. As Inofin is currently in violation of the Consent Order which required the Corporation to ensure that an Auditing Firm prepared and submitted an Audit report to the Division and the current uncertainty regarding when the required audit will become available, a determination of when the Division would be able to evaluate the financial condition of the Corporation likewise remains uncertain.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 25, the Commissioner has determined that:  	(a) Inofin has engaged in, or is about to engage in, acts or practices which warrant the belief that Inofin is not operating honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest in violation of standards governing the licensing and conduct of a motor vehicle sales finance company including, but not limited to, the provisions of M.G.L. chapter 255B and the Division's regulations at 209 CMR 20.00 et seq.;  	(b) The volume and severity of problems are beyond management's ability to control or correct;  	(c) Regulatory measures are necessary to protect the interests of consumers; and  	(d) The public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST to Inofin.  Based upon the information contained in Paragraphs 1 through 25, had the foregoing been known to the Division at the time of Inofin's motor vehicle sales finance company license application, the Commissioner would have been warranted in refusing to issue such license. Further, the facts and conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 25 present sufficient grounds for the revocation of Inofin's motor vehicle sales finance company license pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 255B, section 8. I. ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST  	After taking into consideration the Information stated herein, it is hereby:  ORDERED that Inofin shall immediately cease engaging in the business of a motor vehicle sales finance company or otherwise operate as a motor vehicle sales finance company, as that term is defined under General Laws chapter 255B.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED Inofin shall continue to retain the independent consultant (""Consultant"") previously engaged by the Corporation and identified in the Consent Order, as an interim manager to oversee, direct and coordinate, the operations of the Corporation.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that within one (1) day of the effective date of this Order and Notice, Inofin shall submit to the Division a detailed record, prepared as of the date of submission, of all information on file regarding the Corporation's total Massachusetts contract servicing portfolio including but not limited to:  	(a) the borrower's addresses and telephone numbers;|  	(b) the loan number;  	(c) the account balance; and  	(d) the location of the funds currently held for each account.  	The record should include telephone numbers of appropriate contact persons who are familiar with the Corporation's retail installment contracts.  Within (30) days of the effective date of this Order and Notice Inofin shall transfer all servicing rights for all Massachusetts retail installment loans that the Corporation currently services to a qualified motor vehicle sales finance company, a registered loan servicer, or financial institution, with Division approval.

Inofin or new servicer on its behalf shall notify the consumer of the transfer prior to the date the first payment is due at the new servicers address. Such notices shall include:  	i. The name and address of the new servicer  	ii. The date Inofin will stop accepting payments;  	iii. The date the new servicer will begin accepting payments; and  	iv. Telephone numbers for both Inofin and the new servicer that the consumer can use to call toll-free or collect for more information about the transfer  	v. The notices shall also include a statement that the transfer will not affect any terms or conditions of the consumer's retail installment loan, except those directly related to the servicing of the loan.  	(b) On each business day thereafter, by 5 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, Inofin shall provide to the Commissioner an updated written status report of the list of retail installment loans currently serviced by the Corporation. The status report shall include the categories of information required under subparagraphs 33(a) through (d). The reporting requirement shall continue until each of the retail installment loans serviced by the Corporation are no longer serviced by Inofin. Within 48 hours of the transfer of servicing rights of any retail installment loan included in the list provided by Inofin, the Corporation shall provide a written notice to the Division containing the borrower name, address and loan number and the entity to whom the servicing rights have been transferred.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Inofin shall immediately place all payments collected from Massachusetts consumers relative to any motor vehicle loans serviced by the Corporation in a separate escrow account maintained at a federally insured bank.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Inofin shall not authorize or execute any financial transaction, in excess of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) except for wages and salaries paid to employees, contractors, officers, or other members of Inofin's management in the ordinary course of their business, without the prior written approval of the Commissioner. Upon the effective date of this Order and Notice, Inofin shall implement or revise its practices and procedures, as necessary, to ensure that their financial books and records are accurately maintained, in a manner illustrating compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, and available for review by the Division upon request.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Order and Notice shall not be construed as approving any act, practice, or conduct not specifically set forth herein which was, is, or may be in violation of relevant state or federal laws and regulations.

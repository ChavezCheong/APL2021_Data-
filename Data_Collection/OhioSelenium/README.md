# Automating Downloads from Government Search Portals (Ohio)
The Ohio Department of Commerce stores their Enforcement Actions on a web search portal that had to be searched through and matched against our local CSV list of MEAs issued in Ohio from 2000-2010. As there were over 6900 entries to look through, manual search proved to be a slow and tedious affair. The Selenium script written shortened the process that originally was thought to take 2 weeks to 10 hours.
